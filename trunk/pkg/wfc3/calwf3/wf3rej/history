        - Revised the use of multi-amp gain and noise values in
            'acsrej_init.c' to follow what was done in 'acsrej_loop.c'.
            This methods assigns the two possible values to each line and
            loops over 0-ampx for the first value, and ampx-dimx for the 
            second value, eliminating any 'if...else' checks.
        - Fixed the buffer management in 'acsrej_loop.c'. 
            + reset the 'sum' and 'sumvar' line buffers for each line.
            + normalized the data for 'pic' buffer as it is read in
                so entire buffer has the same normalization, rather than
                having 2 lines of un-normalized data in at all times.  This
                affected the labelling of SPILL pixels when a HIT is 
                detected.  
            + short-circuited SPILL pixel checking when 'radius'
                (variable 'width') is set to 0.
            + simplified the indexing of the SPILL checking loops
            + restored the simpler logic used for calculating the 
                ERROR arrays.  
            + established 2 new line buffers (zerofbuf and zerosbuf)
                which are all zero.  They are used with 'memcpy' to 
                set all other line buffers (sum,sumvar,buf,bufdq,...)
                to zero more efficiently/cleanly than with a 'for()' loop.
            + revised scrolling functions (scroll*Buff) to simply
                use 'memcpy' once then return when CRRADIUS is ZERO
                (i.e., width/bufflines == 1).
            + revised scrolling functions to also use the ZERO buffers 
                and 'memcpy' rather than 'memset' properly reset buffer
                lines beyond the edge of the input image.
            + fixed a memory leak in 'getShadBuff' for the buffer 'zl'
        - Also changed the 'MINVAL' in 'acsrej_sky.c' to better reflect
            the DN range of the ACS CCDs.    

7 Sept 1999 (WJH)
        - Finished major revisions based on code review.  
            + Renamed 'acsrej.h' to 'rej.h' in this directory
            + Modified all files except 'piksrt.c'.
            + Removed 'key2.c' and use functions from 'lib/key.c' instead
            + use only one set of multiamp values for 'gain' and 'readnoise'
                This would be read in from the first image in the input list
            + revised 'acsrej_check.c' to only read the first image when
                possible.  
            + changed the list of parameters in 'newpar' to correspond more
                directly to the column names in CRREJTAB
            + incorporated 'strtor' into 'readpar.c' and removed 'strtor.c'
            + revised method of binning to calculate sky values in 'acsrej_sky'
            + cleaned up 'cr_mode' calculation to properly calculate ranges
            + revised 'acsrej_init' to use DQ array and SingleGroup
            + consolidated 'shadcorr' calls as much as possible, as
                well as cleaning up use of 'gn' and 'noise' values.
            + renamed buffer functions in 'acsrej_loop' to better reflect
                the type of variable that is used
            + changed ShadBuff functions in 'acsrej_loop' to 'static'
                and to pass all variables by value
            + revised functions to call 'c_imtlen' as few times as possible
            + modified most math functions and loops over pixels to set the 
                upper limit as an INT variable and use it, rather than
                referencing the value from the structure on each pixel.          

Mar 30 1999
        - Revision to use gain/readnoise arrays directly instead of 
            calling a function every pixel to get the values.  Also, 
            status only set to error conditions, not to OK.  
            
Nov 24 1998 
		- First complete version for CALACS with trailer file management,
			line-by-line I/O and unified error handling within CALACS.
			

Jan 22 1998	- edit crrej_do.c such that the keyword NCOMBINE is added 
		  to the output file's science extension header, instead of 
		  to the primary header.
		- edit cr_history.c to replace put_key_X calls with PutKeyX.
		- edit key2.c to print a message when a new keyword is added.

/* This routine finds an edge (expected to be fairly sharp) in 1-D data.

   Status return of NO_GOOD_DATA means we cannot find the current edge.
   That will not be a fatal error unless we can't find any edge at all.

   I'm being lazy here and doing the cross correlation on the entire v
   array.  If this turns out to be a good algorithm, I should reduce the
   range of the cross correlation.

   Phil Hodge, 1997 Sept 11:
	Reduce the interval [first,last] if there are bad pixels,
	rather than just giving up.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Dec 11:
	Add sts to calling sequence, for sp_range and dbg; write info
	to debug file.

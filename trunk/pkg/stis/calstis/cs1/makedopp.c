/* This routine computes the Doppler smearing function.

Doppler smearing:

          --------- photon would have hit here if no Doppler shift

         |        --------- photon was observed here due to Doppler shift

The picture above represents a 5 x 5 pixel section of an image, with
dispaxis = 1 (X axis) and dispsign = +1 (wavelength increases to the
right).  The Doppler shift is two pixels to the red; this could
correspond to a time of observation within one half orbital period
following doppzero (see below).

Before applying a flat field (or dark, etc.) to a science file, the
reference file should be shifted two pixels to the left.

Doppzero is a time when the Doppler shift is zero, and HST is near its
closest approach to the target.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Mar 13:
	Change calling sequence, replacing s0 with d0;
	don't extract the non-zero subset of Doppler smearing array.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Apr 2:
	Change the sign of the Doppler shift.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Oct 5:
	Change status value 1001 to GENERIC_ERROR_CODE.

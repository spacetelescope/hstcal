/* This function checks for the existence of the reference files that
   we need.  There are a couple of cases where a reference file need not
   be specified (dqitab, if CCD, and flat fields), but if a file name
   was given, we require that the file exist.

   This function may be called more than once, e.g. for science and
   wavecal RefFileInfo structs.  Note that InitNames must have been
   called prior to calling this routine, as SaveName is called.

   The keywords that are given special treatment are BPIXTAB,
   PFLTFILE, DFLTFILE, LFLTFILE, PCTAB, APERTAB, and WCPTAB.

   Phil Hodge, 1997 Dec 10:
	File created.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Jan 13:
	Include PCTAB and APERTAB as "special" files.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 July 14:
	Include MOFFTAB as a "special" file.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Nov 20:
	Include WCPTAB as a "special" file.

   Phil Hodge, 1999 Dec 6:
	Use tbtopn instead of openInputImage to check for the existence
	of both tables and (by appending "[0]") images.

   Phil Hodge, 2001 May 4:
	Remove MOFFTAB as a "special" file.  We no longer use this table.

   Phil Hodge, 2003 Jun 20:
	Remove the check on wbiafile.

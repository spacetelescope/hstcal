   X will be used, and the profile values will be linearly interpolated.

   The X coordinate of a given record is definde by

   Notice that the X value is not stored in the output record. It is
   the caller's responsibility to keep track of X pixel coordinates.

   it is assumed that *output is actually a valid pointer to a ProfileArray,
   i.e. that the memory has been allocated.

   corresponding to the X column in the image.

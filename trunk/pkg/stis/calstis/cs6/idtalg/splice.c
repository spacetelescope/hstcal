/*
   splice --  Merges echelle orders.

   The input data lives in an array of RowContents elements. The output
   wavelength and flux arrays are allocated by this function but must
   be fred by the caller (their exact size is only known after the
   entire spectrum is spliced together). The NET column in the RowContents
   structure is used for filling up the flux array.

   This function also takes care of the conversion between counts/s
   to counts units.

   This function was written with the assumption that all spectral
   orders carry the same number of pixels, which is a reasonable
   assumption as long as calstis6std doesn't change its behavior.

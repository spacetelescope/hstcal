This documents the issues which have been identified as needing revision
within CALACS.  

Based on Version 4.1c (14-Jan-2003):
    - computing the bias level (OPR ?): sigma clipping needs to be performed
    on the overscan values used in the fit.  This will prevent cosmic-rays from
    skewing the fit and introducing a ramp in the background from incorrect bias
    subtraction.
    
    - bias level for each amp should be reported (OPR 46897): The header should
    be updated with the computed bias value for each amp.  This will allow users
    to verify that there were no problems, and allow for tracking of bias levels
    for calibration purposes.
    


Version 3.5b represents the final updated version for launch support based
    on the first delivery of ground-based reference files.  
    
    SHADCORR and ATODCORR may or may not need to be turned off.
    STATFLAG may need to be turned on in pipeline. It is tested in CALACS.

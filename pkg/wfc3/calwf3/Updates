Updates for Version 3.3 25-Aug-2015 MLS
    - changed pow() to powf() in the readnoise calculation to deal with memory overrun producing nans in some cases

Updates for Version 3.3 24-Aug-2015 MLS
    - updated the mac os version check in wscript to use sw_vers, the old way was returning junk and we need it for adding the 64bit flags to the compile
    - added some initializations the clang compiler complained about

Updates for Version 3.3 20-Aug-2015 MLS
    - I changed a float to double in wf3cte readnoise section for added precision
    - moved GetGlobalInfo and checkGlobal info higher in the code to reject non-wfc3 datasets
    - moved a delete section further out in the logic and that seemed to fix #1220, tests on cte and non-cte data seemed happy

Updates for Version 3.3 18-Aug-2015 MLS
    -BuildDthInput has to create the input filename from the asn root, but this can be either FLT or FLC now, have to figure out which one to use.
    -Had to add separate DTH pass for IR data and double DTH pass for UVIS data because the input filename for RPTCORR/EXPCORR associations are built in the code from the data rootnames in the ASN table. So the UVIS data coming out of procccd has to take a double pass through DTH when PCTECORR is PERFORM.
    -changed the checking order for subarrays in the PCTECORR routine so that it errors out cleanly (has to do with 1 group of images for subarrays)
    -added the check for INSTRUMENT == WFC3 back to the code, actually related to a user complainging that calwf3 didn't tell them it couldn't reduce ACS data.
    -had to update the procir call to wf3rej_0 signature for the asn update I added to uvis
    -updated the mainrej.e calls which were segfaulting (calling wf3rej standalone on input list of images)
    -added dynamic memory allocation for trailer file list to initrejtrl
    -updated text in wf3rej to report that Astrodrizzle should be used to align images instead of PyDrizzle since that's how it's advertised to users 
    -found a problem (even in the released version of calwf3) with output file for associations with multiple products, created #1220

Updates for Version 3.3 12-Aug-2015 MLS
    -fix for #1215 binned data detection for sink pixel seg faults

Updates for Version 3.3 11-Aug-2015 MLS
    -nrej initialized in wf3rej so that REJ_RATE reported consistently correct, see #1214
    -fix for #1216, the BIACFILE name was not being populated for bias images with BIASCORR == OMIT
    -I also went ahead and added a clean exit for images going to PCTECORR which already have BIASCORR complete

Updates for Version 3.3  21-July-2015 MLS
    -Debugged version of the CTE code committed.
    -see #1193 ticket for extensive changes

Updates for Version 3.3  31-May-2015 MLS
    UVIS 2.0 added, including CTE correction, Sink Pixel and Photometry updates
    (#1011) New photometry correction for UVIS. This includes a delivery of new flatfields for all filters in CDBS
            as well as a new IMPHTTAB. The new calibration step is controlled by the FLUXCORR keyword in the image header.

    (#1154) CTE correction for all UVIS data. This is done in conjunction with a full run through of the pipeline code
    without the CTE correction applied. This correction is for the same reasons as in ACS, but the CTE correction method
    and code are different, and they are applied to the raw file instead of later in the processing. Some sections of the CTE
    code support parallel processing with OpenMP. The default for calwf3 is to use all available processors. To restrict
    processing to 1 cpu use the flag -1 in the call to calwf3.e  The cte processing is controlled with the PCTECORR keyword. 
    
    Sink pixels added to the science image DQ mask using the SNKCFILE reference image. This image has 2 extensions,
    each in the pre-overscan trimmed format. This step is performed if DQICORR is PERFORM, and is done before BLEVCORR
    while the science image is still untrimmed.
    
    (see #1193 for more detailed information on all the updates)
        
Updates for  Version 3.2.1 08-Dec-2014 MLS
    The FLUXCORR step has been updated, changing how the data is processed in the flow of the pipeline. It was discovered that
    a chain of requirements meant that the values from the IMPHTTAB were not being read or updated correctly. This is a multifold
    problem which starts with the way that the IMPHTTAB is read and how it is constructed. Since the file, and it's calling functions,
    are common to all instruments, the best way around it was to move where the fluxcorr step was done in the pipeline to OUTSIDE the
    main wf32d loop. The step then reads in the FLT file which was written out and updates the SCI,1 data and headers with the photometry keyword
    information.    


Updates for  Version 3.2 09-Dec-2013 MLS
    A new calibration step was added to the UVIS process, FLUXCORR, can now be run at the end of regular
    processing. It will scale the chip2 image using the new PHTFLAM1 and PHTFLAM2 values in the IMPHTAB.
    New flatfields for all filters, as well as a new IMPHTTAB will be delivered by the team for this step
    to be completely implemented. This is a significant version increase since I had to modify the globablly
    access GetPhotTab to read the new WFC3 imphttab correctly, as well as touch many routines in the calwf3 process.
    (#1088, #1011, #1025)
    
Updates for Version 3.1.6 15-Nov-2013 MLS
    Fixed a file i/o issue after change in cfitsio interaction (see #970, #1073 and #1069)
    
Updates for  Version 3.1.5  30-Sept-2013 MLS
     Fixed the individual task executables for wf3ir, wf3ccd, wf32d to properly used the user specfied output filename
     when they are called standalone (#1049)

Updates for  Version 3.1.4  9-Sept-2013 MLS

    Updated the postflash routine and sub1d and multk1d to perform the correct subarray
    calibration for all cases. (#983) The previous update was not sufficient for team subarrays.
    
Updates for  Version 3.1.3  26-Mar-2013 MLS

    Updated the postflash routine to apply the correct offset for all amps
    when a user specified subarray is used (no GO users are allowed to do this)
  
    Some unrelated files will change because I formatted the indentation to make
    the code easier to decipher

Updates for Version 3.1.2 11-Feb-2013 - MLS
    - Updated the bias subtraction to check for CCDAMP values of SINGLE_AMP and
    SINGLE_OR_ALL in the reference bias file image when a full frame reference file 
    and a  user specified subarray are used so that the correct overscan region is ignored

    - Removed check for TDFTRANS per team request, see #980, I'm keeping the same version as
    the previous change because I havent delivered it yet

    -Added correct pixel offset for subarray images taken with amp B or D for post-flash corretion

Updates for Version 3.1.1 2-Jan-2013 - MLS 
    File I/O in acsrej updated to avoid problems with CFITSIO upcasting  
    file permissions to read/write when not needed. This will allow the 
    hstio code to remove logic that allowed the old code to work but  
    caused problems for CADC when CFITSIO opened ref files in read/write  
    mode because of that hstio logic.

    lib/tabpedigree.c:
	When tbtopn has a failure, reset status to zero before returning, so

	close trailer file (PR 66366; Trac #622).
    wf3ir/cridcalc.c:

    wf3ir/doir.c:
	Upgraded crimage header updates to include check of flatcorr status

    wf3ir/groupinfo.c:
	Upgraded getDataUnits routine to recognize BUNIT values of ELECTRONS,
	to support re-entrant processing. (PR 66081; Trac #608)
    wf3ir/irhist.c:
	Upgraded noisIRHistory routine to first check setting of noiscorr
	switch before adding history keyword, to support re-entrant processing.
	(PR 66081; Trac #608)
    wf3ir/noiscalc.c:
	Modified doNoisIR to print trailer message and noiscorr value, and also
	give a message saying that noiscorr is skipped if noiscalc returns with
	an error. Noiscalc was modified to see if the ERR array is already
	populated before doing the calculation, to support re-entrant
	processing. (Pr 66081; Trac #608)

	Modified logic and processing flow so that if CRCORR=PERFORM and
	EXPSCORR=PERFORM, run wf32d on the individual exposures *after*
	crcorr is complete, so that CR flags inserted into blv_tmp files
	by crcorr will show up in final flt images produced by wf32d.
	(PR 64963; Trac #545)
    wf3rej.cl:
	Modified to place the user-supplied crsigmas param string in quotes
	when appending to the command line, so that embedded blanks don't
	cause problems for the parser. (PR 64941; Trac #544)
    wf3rej/readpar.c:
	Updated the strtor routine to match the one in the calstis lib, which
	skips over leading and embedded blanks in the string.
	(PR 64941; Trac #544)

	(PR 64260; Trac #494)
    wf32d/doflat.c:
	Modified divFlat to use mean_gain for all images, including grisms.
	(PR 64259; Trac #493)
    wf3ir/blevcorr.c:
	Swapping order of zsig and blev such that zsig occurs first requires
	sending zoff image to blevcorr to be processed. (PR 64262; Trac #496)
    wf3ir/cridcalc.c:
	Added check for pixels already saturated in zeroth read (detected by
	zsigcorr), in which case outputs set to zero. Switch from using
	commanded ccdgain to mean_gain. Modified linfit to include readnoise
	in sample weights and Poisson noise from source in final fit
	uncertainty. Added SPIKE_THRESH in RejSpikes to use a separate
	rejection threshold from CR thresh. Updated hardwired dark and
	readnoise to use SMOV results. Some general cleanup.
	(PR 64630; Trac #518)
    wf3ir/doir.c:
	Changed order of processing so that doZsig is called before doBlev.

	Compute zero-read sample time (sampzero) here instead of in zsigcorr.
	(PR 63711; Trac #457)

    wf3ir/refdata.c:
	Fixed initialization of maxcrsplit variable.
    wf3ir/unitcorr.c:
	No longer need to check status of ZSIGCORR before using sampzero,
	because sampzero is always computed in doIR. (PR 63711; Trac #457)
    wf3ir/zsigcorr.c:
	Set ZEROSIG DQ values along with SATPIXEL flags. Set and count pixels
	as saturated in first read if they're saturated in zeroth read. Only
	check for saturation in first read if not already flagged as saturated
	in zeroth. For pixels saturated in zeroth or first reads, recompute
	zsig from difference of zeroth read and super-zero zsci. 
	(PR 64262; Trac #496)
	Moved computation of sampzero into doIR. (PR 63711; Trac #457)

    calwf3.cl:
	Increment version to "14Oct2009".
    wf3version.h:
	Increment version to 1.7 and date to 14-Oct-2009.
    wf3ir/cridcalc.c:
	Updated the crrej routine to use the badinpdq value from the CRREJTAB
	to set the DQIGNORE constant, which is used to reject samples, rather
	than having it hardwired to a value in the code. The hardwired value
	had been set to just SATPIXEL, which meant that pixels flagged with
	other values such as DETECTORPROB (4), BADZERO (8), HOTPIX (16), and
	UNSTABLE (32) were not being blanked out in the output flt image.
	(PR 63556; Trac ticket #454)

	Added use of CRREJTAB to allow user input of CR rejection threshold
	instead of having it hardwired in the code. Decreased max_CRs from 6 to
	4. Reinstated old loop limits code that excludes reference pixels from
	ramp fitting. Fixed bug in logic that identifies pixels already
	saturated in first read. Don't set HIGH_CURVATURE flag in ouput DQ 
	arrays, use UNSTABLE instead, and change messages to say UNSTABLE. Also
	don't set ZEROSIG value in output crimage (flt file) DQ array, because
	those pixels are still OK (assuming no other flag also set). Removed 
	unnecessary call to EstimateDarkandGlow at end of processing. Fixed 
	calculation of output SAMP and TIME values. Fixed bug in logic that 
	identifies pixels with only 1 good sample. Fixed bug in computation of 
	"firstgood" and "lastgood" assignments for pixels with no acceptable 
	samples.  (Trac tickets #352, 365, 376, 377, 381)
    wf3ir/getirflags.c:

	MultiDrizzle capability is added to WFC3 pipeline.
    lib/mkspt.c:
	Corrected the calculation of the number of extensions in output spt
        files for WFC3 (IR files have a pair of extensions for each nsamp).
    wf3rej/cr_history.c:

	from there).
    wf3rej/rej_init.c, rej_loop.c, rej_sky.c:
	Added calls to hstio getHeader before each call to getShortLine, in
	order to prevent getShortLine from crashing on null input DQ arrays.

        Changed UVIS channel detector keyword to always use "UVIS1".
        Changed use of "A2Dx" gain keyword to "DN" and eliminated use of
        it for UVIS images because flatfielding leaves them in units of
        electrons, not counts.
    wf3ir/darkcorr.c:
	Eliminated use of RebinRef, because we don't want to extract 
	subarrays from a full-frame dark ref image, we want to instead 
	use a matching subarray dark ref image.

	Enhanced FindOverscan routine to handle IR images differently than
	UVIS, selecting oscntab row based on image size (nx,ny) instead of
	binning.
    wf3ir/blevcorr.c:
	Enhanced to set reference pixel statistics computation limits based
	on biassect values in oscntab, rather than image trim values.
    wf3rej/wf3rej.c:
	Fixed memory reallocation in InitRejTrl that was causing a crash for
	very large numbers of input images. Made reallocation increment
	much larger, so that it doesn't get called repeatedly.

Updates for Version 0.3 - 20 Feb 2004 (HAB):
    calwf3.cl:
	Increment version to 0.3.
    wf3.h:
	Added ATOD_SATURATE macro definition.
    wf3dq.h:
	Added ATODSAT dq value of 2048 and changed existing ZEROSIG from
	2048 to 4096.
    wf3version.h:
	Incremented version to 0.3 and date to 20-Feb-2004.
    lib/dodqi.c:
	Modified to make CCDAMP and CCDGAIN columns optional when looking
	for matching rows in BPIXTAB. Added handling of new ATODSAT dq flag.
    lib/donoise.c:
	Fixed use of amp boundaries to take into account WFC3 serial virtual
	overscan regions.
    lib/getccdtab.c:
	Changed use of wf3->binaxis to wf3->bin to make it work properly
	for binned science images.
    lib/getgrp.c:
	Eliminated the ACS practice of hardwiring wf3->bin to 1 and instead
	populate it by reading BINAXIS keywords from sci extension header.
    lib/getkeys.c:
        Eliminated attempt to read BINAXIS keywords from primary header
	because for WFC3 they're in the sci extension header.
    lib/loadhead.c:
	Minor code cleanup.
    wf3ccd/doblev.c:
	Implemented limit on sdev to be sqrt(mean) for first pass in
	CleanBiasFit and use readnoise as value of sdev for second pass.
	Added readnoise ('rn') as input to cleanBiasFit.
    wf3ccd/doccd.c:
	Minor comment change.
    wf3rej/rej_loop.c:
	Commented out unused LoadHdr function declaration. Removed SQ(scale*val)
	from sumvar computation. Changed AllocBitBuff to work with arbitrary
	buffer sizes rather than only those evenly divisible by 8.

Updates for Version 0.2 - 28 Oct 2003 (HAB):
    wf3info.h:
	Changed datatype of 'ccdgain' from int to float.
	Added 'blev(NAMPS)' to WF3Info struct so WF3CCD can remember all
	blev values for all extensions/amps. Added 'expscorr' to WF3Info
	struct for use in WF32D.
    wf3version.h:
	Incremented version to 0.2 and date to 28-Oct-2003.
    wf3wild.h:
	Added 'FLT_WILDCARD' and 'FLT_IGNORE' macros for use in floating-pt
	get/put keyword functions.
    calwf3/calwf3.h:
	Changed datatype of 'scigain' from int to float.
    calwf3/calwf3.c:
	Removed unique code for RPTCORR processing and made it same as CRCORR
	for UVIS images.
    calwf3/getinfo.c:
	Changed datatype of 'scigain' values from int to float.
    calwf3/getrefffiles.c:
	Load 'CRREJTAB' ref table if RPTCORR is turned on (to make it same
	as CRCORR for UVIS images).
    calwf3/getswitches.c:
	Changed to handle RPTCORR switch the same as CRCORR for UVIS images.
    calwf3/procccd.c:
	Changed to handle RPTCORR processing same as CRCORR for UVIS images.
	Added check on status value returned from WF3Rej. If set to
	'NO_GOOD_DATA', it will reset 'wf3hdr->sci_basic_2d' to 'SKIPPED' so
	that no further processing will be performed. It then resets the
	status value to 'WF3_OK' for continuing normally.
    calwf3/wf3table.c:
	Changed to handle RPTCORR processing same as CRCORR for UVIS images.
    lib/wf3info.c:
	Added initialization of new wf3->blev array.
    lib/dodqi.c:
	Updated to treat commanded gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    lib/donoise.c:
	Added logic to use Amp C/D bias values from new blev array for UVIS
	Chip 2 instead of relying on 'AMPY' logic.
    lib/getccdtab.c:
	Updated to treat commanded gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    lib/getkeys.c:
	Updated to treat commanded gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    lib/mkspt.c:
	Updated a couple of printf statements to use trlmessage so that the
	comments on creating the SPT file also make it to the trailer file.
    lib/sameint.c:
	Added new 'SameFlt' routine for use with gain keyword values.
    lib/trlbuf.c:
	Increased 'trldata' buffer size from 'SZ_FNAME' to 'SZ_LINE'.
    lib/key.c:
	Changed putKeyBool function type from Bool to int.
    wf32d/wf32d.c:
	Added 'expscorr' switch as command-line argument for wf32d.
    wf32d/do2d.c:
	Update final state of 'expscorr' switch in output header.
    wf32d/photmode.c:
	Updated to treat gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    wf3ccd/wf3ccd.c:
	Populate BIASLEV[abcd] keywords in output header using new
	'BiasKeywords' function.
    wf3ccd/blevfit.c:
	Added BlevResults function to return the values of the slope and
	intercept computed for the bias fit. Also, the fit reports the values
	to the user in a trailer message.
    wf3ccd/doatod.c:
	Updated to treat commanded gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    wf3ccd/doblev.c:
	Added 'cleanBiasFit' routine to do sigma-clipping on bias measurements
	before computing fit. Set default ccdbias value to be AMP C/D value
	for UVIS Chip 2 data where no overscan was available for computing
	the bias level.
	Modified to load the 'biassect' array with indexes corresponding to
	the serial physical overscan regions, instead of serial virtual
	overscan regions, when processing UVIS subarray images (which have no
	serial virtual overscan).
    wf3ccd/doccd.c:
	Added processing msg's giving info on bias levels for each amp.
	Upgraded to do correct overscan trimming of output image for UVIS
	subarray modes, in which there's no serial virtual overscan to
	remove, and variable amounts of serial physical overscan.
    wf3ccd/findover.c:
	Modified to zero-out all serial and parallel virtual biassect and 
	trim values when processing UVIS subarray images (which don't have
	any virtual overscan). Also fixed a bug in which one of the biassect
	values was not being converted from 1-indexed to 0-indexed in the
	case of subarray images.
    wf3ir/dqicorr.c:
	Updated to treat commanded gain values as float datatype instead of int.
    wf3ir/getirflags.c:
	Modified to load DARKCORR and NLINCORR switch settings and DARKFILE
	and NLINFILE ref file info if ZSIGCORR is set to PERFORM.
    wf3ir/nlincorr.c:
	Modified to use just 1 node array from the NLINFILE ref data, which
	is the saturation value. There won't be another node array specifying
	the lower bound of the nlin correction as with NICMOS.
    wf3ir/refdata.c:
	Modified to load just 1 node array from the NLINFILE ref file. Also
	modified to combine all of the PFLT, DFLT, and LFLT ref file data
	(if present) into a master flat, as is done for UVIS processing.
    wf3ir/zsigcorr.c:
	Modified to use just 1 node array from the NLINFILE ref data, which is
	the saturation value.
    wf3rej/wf3rej.c:
	Added call to 'mkNewSpt' within error condition for wf3rej_do to
	always produce a new SPT file for product when possible. This also
	involved remembering the value of the error condition, setting it
	to WF3_OK, calling 'mkNewSpt', then resetting to old value in order
	to allow 'mkNewSpt' to work successfully.
    wf3rej/rej_do.c:
	Added code to count number of inputs with exptime>0. If some are
	zero, new code will insure that first good image gets used to
	initialize the initial guess image. Revised to handle cases where
	0,1,or more input are valid. If none have exptime>0, skips wf3rej_loop
	altogether and output a blank image with DQ values of 1 and ERR values
	of 0 with the exception of the 0,0 pixel, which have values of 8 and
	-1 respectively, to forces HSTIO to write out the image arrays. It
	now returns status=NO_GOOD_DATA if there are no inputs with 
	exptime>0.
    wf3rej/rej_init.c:
	Added code to count number of inputs with exptime>0. Also now checks
	whether exptime!=0 when building initial guess image.
    wf3rej/rej_loop.c:
	Added code to avoid crashing when exp[n]=0 for an input image. It will
	now skip all the detection code when exp[n]=0.
    wf3rej/cr_scaling.c:
	Added trailer file comments to better describe how exptime=0 cases
	are handled.

Updates for Version 0.1 - 26 Nov 2002 (HAB):
    Initial installation of baseline CALWF3 into stlocal$testwf3 pkg.

08-June-2023 - MDD - Version 3.7.0
    -  Implementation to use an image to detect and flag full-well saturation versus a simple scalar.
       The new routine, dofwsat.c, is similar to what has been done for calacs. The WFC3 implementation
       is more complicated in that there are serial virtual overscan columns, as well as binned images,
       to accommodate.  The detection/flagging occurs after blev and bias corrections while the output is
       still in counts.  If the SATUFILE keyword is missing from the FITS header, or the keyword does
       not have a valid filename as a value, the code will revert to using the original method of flagging
       full-well saturation.  The flagging will be done in doDQI and use a single value as the saturation 
       threshold.

27-May-2021 - MDD - Version 3.6.2
    - Bug fix to address calwf3.e crashing (Abort trap: 6) when taking an existing *_ima.fits (IR) file
      (produced with FLATCORR=PERFORM and CRCORR=OMIT) with CRCORR set to PERFORM. This reentrant
      processing is fundamental to being able to remove the variable IR background during the course
      of an exposure.  Problem: char variable declared too small to hold its largest possible contents.

28-Apr-2021 - MDD - Version 3.6.1
    - Bug fix to address a problem detected when processing a Tungsten flat with a high background.
      Uninitialized values were used for further computation causing an eventual exception.

31-Dec-2020 - MDD - Version 3.6.0
    - Implementation of a significantly upgraded CTE correction as defined/derived by J. Anderson.
      The upgraded CTE algorithm is also streamlined and executes faster then the previous version.

12-Aug-2020 - MDD - Version 3.5.2
    - Added MJD as a parameterized variable for the PHOTMODE keyword to
      enable a time-dependent photometric correction for the UVIS only.
    - Fixed a bug in the IMPHTTAB package to support properly data with 
      multiple imsets, in conjunction with a parameterized value.

24-Jun-2020 - MDD - Version 3.5.1
    - Replaced/modified routines based upon copyright numerical recipes routines.
      Updates implemented Oct 2019, but installation delayed for higher priority updates.

14-Oct-2018 - JAN/MDD - Version 3.5.0
    - Bug fixes to the CTE correction to fix out of bounds memory access and remove unnecessary critical section.

19-Jan-2018 - JAN/MDD - Version 3.4.2
    - A number of code robustness improvements (address memory leaks, fix detected bugs) were implemented.

10-Apr-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Fixed missed init for header vars in cte code

02-Apr-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Fixed logic brackets in subarray prescan bias call which didn't explicitly do the gain correction in the if loop, see Issue #55
    - Fixed double statement, see Issue #63

27-Mar-2017 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Update photometry keyword descriptions in UVIS

28-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Fixed memory allocation around one more print

26-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Fixed memory allocation around prints

20-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Moved the init for the CTE params back to the top of the code, it had gotten moved below the header update for the information

14-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - CTE subarrays enabled for user supported subarrays with physical overscan

06-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Sink pixel flagging for subarray appears correct now

18-July-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - CTE and Sink Pixel implementation for subarrays submitted by Brechmos for review

28-Jan-2016 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Removed the call to WF3Dth for the CTE data. This is essentially useless since the DTH step has been replaced with astrodrizzle, the only function it has it to concatinate the SPT files from the association members into a new spt file with the product/subproduct name. This is already done for the non-cte processed data, there is no difference between the cte and non-cte SPT files, they are only related to the RAW input file.

22-Jan-2016 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Noticed I missed renaming the crc file with the call to WF3DTH and was setting the input to the crj suffix, but also needed updates to GetAsnTable to include crc filename population for subproducts and sending the correct subproduct through processing, it was always using crj
    - some code cleanup as I went
    - trailer file concatination update, but it's still not entirely correct

19-Jan-2016 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Updates to fix trailer file output information. Part of the problem is the change in name of the output RAC_TMP file, the functions which create input and output trailer file naming conventions look for the dot to separate extensions so I need to change some expectations.
    - Update to check for the raw header value of PCTENSMD and update the cte parameter table accordingly (though only a value of 0 is valid right now)

08-Jan-2016 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - changed the name of the output rac file to rac_tmp so that archive could handle deleting it better

05-Nov-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - removed explicit downcasts and added calloc returns in procccd

04-Nov-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - add more explicity initializations where I could find them

24-Oct-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - The nightly build is specifying a higher level of optimization through to the compiler than the debug mode that I have been using for my testing. Building calwf3 with the lower optimization produced no errors or warnings and ran through cleanly, but the high optimization brought on a segfault inside the CTE code in the first openmp section. This was only happening on the Linux cluster, the MAC builds showed no issue. I went back 2 versions of the wf3cte.c code and redid the changes by hand step by step. The problem area seemed to be a set of arrays which would rather be doubles than floats. I also changed the remaining floats to doubles, where I could, and removed more of the memcpy statements, making them regular array assignments. These things seem to have cleared the issues, and hopefully preventing new ones for now.
    - I also removed a superfluous openmp print statement from maincte.c and cleaned up some more informational print statements.
    - I added a time measurement, with verbose on the code prints how long the CTE section took to run, with the specification of number of threads/cpus.

21-Oct-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Editing text for the screen and trailer files
    - Formally removed the rac file before the routine ends since archive isn't expecting it

16-Oct-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - machine dependent bug, some images were getting nan values on linux machines
    - I also removed the temporary image saves we were using for the CTE routines

29-Sep-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - bug in original fortran code fixed; the final RAC image should be made by subtracting the CHG image (the net cte effect) from the original non-BIC subtracted raw data. This should remove the additional bias signature that Matthew was seeing in the stacked dark frames. It should NOT make a significant change in the overall output of the code since bias levels are low to begin with.

    - I also changed the way the code uses the SCLBYCOL reference file (as called in Jays fortran). The way the fortran code is structured, the reference file information never actually gets used in the calculation. This doesn't make a numerical difference at the moment because the reference file values are all ones, ie. there is no additional scaling done on the CTE pixel other than by using the CTE scaling fraction and the column location. However, if the science team ever delivers a new reference file which has these values updated, they wont actually get used by the code un
less this change is implemented.

   - Reformatted some code for readability, and fixed SEGFAULT error in reference file checking when iref environment variable not set by user, so can't find file (also when can't find file in general). I made RefExist exit clean the first time it found a missing file, HSTIO was barfing any other way.

24-Sep-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - fix for machine dependent precision bug

03-Sep-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - One more precision change needed for the nans in the readnoise section

28-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - These updates appear to fix the nan issue in the readnoise step that we ran into with some images
    - I also made the cte code a bit more tidy and organized

25-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - changed pow() to powf() in the readnoise calculation to deal with memory overrun producing nans in some cases

24-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - updated the mac os version check in wscript to use sw_vers, the old way was returning junk and we need it for adding the 64bit flags to the compile
    - added some initializations the clang compiler complained about

20-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - I changed a float to double in wf3cte readnoise section for added precision
    - moved GetGlobalInfo and checkGlobal info higher in the code to reject non-wfc3 datasets
    - moved a delete section further out in the logic and that seemed to fix #1220, tests on cte and non-cte data seemed happy

18-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - BuildDthInput has to create the input filename from the asn root, but this can be either FLT or FLC now, have to figure out which one to use.
    - Had to add separate DTH pass for IR data and double DTH pass for UVIS data because the input filename for RPTCORR/EXPCORR associations are built in the code from the data rootnames in the ASN table. So the UVIS data coming out of procccd has to take a double pass through DTH when PCTECORR is PERFORM.
    - changed the checking order for subarrays in the PCTECORR routine so that it errors out cleanly (has to do with 1 group of images for subarrays)
    - added the check for INSTRUMENT == WFC3 back to the code, actually related to a user complainging that calwf3 didn't tell them it couldn't reduce ACS data.
    - had to update the procir call to wf3rej_0 signature for the asn update I added to uvis
    - updated the mainrej.e calls which were segfaulting (calling wf3rej standalone on input list of images)
    - added dynamic memory allocation for trailer file list to initrejtrl
    - updated text in wf3rej to report that Astrodrizzle should be used to align images instead of PyDrizzle since that's how it's advertised to users
    - found a problem (even in the released version of calwf3) with output file for associations with multiple products, created #1220

12-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - fix for #1215 binned data detection for sink pixel seg faults

11-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -REJ_RATE reported consistently now with nrej initialized in wf3rej
    -fix for #1216, the BIACFILE name was not being populated for bias images with BIASCORR == OMIT
    -I also went ahead and added a clean exit for images going to PCTECORR which already have BIASCORR complete

5-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -More fixes related to pipeline changes added, see #1193 for details

21-July-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -Debugged version of the CTE code committed.
    -see #1193 ticket for extensive changes

31-May-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    The first version of UVIS2, including the CTE, Sink Pixel, and photometry changes.

08-Dec-2014 - MLS -- Version 3.2.1
    The FLUXCORR step has been updated, changing how the data is processed in the flow of the pipeline. It was discovered that
    a chain of requirements meant that the values from the IMPHTTAB were not being read or updated correctly. This is a multifold
    problem which starts with the way that the IMPHTTAB is read and how it is constructed. Since the file, and it's calling functions,
    are common to all instruments, the best way around it was to move where the fluxcorr step was done in the pipeline to OUTSIDE the
    main wf32d loop. The step then reads in the FLT file which was written out and updates the SCI,1 data and headers with the photometry keyword
    information.

09-Dec-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.2
    A new calibration step was added to the UVIS process, FLUXCORR, can now be run at the end of regular
    processing. It will scale the chip2 image using the new PHTFLAM1 and PHTFLAM2 values in the IMPHTAB.
    New flatfields for all filters, as well as a new IMPHTTAB will be delivered by the team for this step
    to be completely implemented. This is a significant version increase since I had to modify the globablly
    access GetPhotTab to read the new WFC3 imphttab correctly, as well as touch many routines in the calwf3 process.

15-Nov-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.6
    Fixed a file i/o issue after change in cfitsio interaction (see #970, #1073 and #1069)

30-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.5
    1049: Fixed the individual task executables for wf3ir, wf3ccd, wf32d to properly used the user
    specfied output filename when they are called standalone

09-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.4
    983: Updated the postflash routine and sub1d and multk1d to perform the correct subarray
    calibration for all cases. The previous update was not sufficient for team subarrays.

26-Mar-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.3
    Updated the postflash routine to apply the correct offset for all amps
    when a user specified subarray is used (no GO users are allowed to do this)

    Some unrelated files will change because I formatted the indentation to make
    the code easier to decipher

11-Feb-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.2
    Updated the bias subtraction to check for CCDAMP values of SINGLE_AMP and
    SINGLE_OR_ALL in the reference bias file image when a full frame reference file
    and a  user specified subarray are used so that the correct overscan region is ignored

    Removed check for TDFTRANS per team request, see #980, I'm keeping the same version as
    the previous change because I havent delivered it yet

    Added correct pixel offset for subarray images taken with amp B or D for post-flash corretion

2-Jan-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.1
    File I/O in acsrej updated to avoid problems with CFITSIO upcasting
    file permissions to read/write when not needed. This will allow the
    hstio code to remove logic that allowed the old code to work but
    caused problems for CADC when CFITSIO opened ref files in read/write
    mode because of that hstio logic.

31-Dec-2012 ML versions 3.1
            fixed TrlBufInit bug, the init in the trlbuf structure wasn't being set to 1 on int
            causing calwf3 to always abort after the check message was added.
28-Dec-2012 ML Version 3.1
            Updated to account for a memory leak on linux machines during BuildDth
             when RPTCORR is off and a new spt is being constructed (#967)

27-Jan-2012: CALWF3 2.6.2: Decreased max number of images to be combined in
             wf3rej from 250 to 120 because OPUS is still getting errors

24-Jan-2012: CALWF3 2.6.1: Updated procir.c to check for the number of images,
             because there were singletons coming through OPUS that had
             RPTCORR=PERFRORM, which were failing when calwf3 tried to
             apply wf3rej.

15-Dec-2011: CALWF3 2.6: Implemented the following PRs:

             ref image before returning.
  68993/748: Updated the cridcalc.c crrej routine to free memory for the
             tot_ADUs array before returning.

 17-Jun-2011: CALWF3 2.4: Implemented the following PRs:
  68593/722: Modified the error handling logic in calwf3 and wf3rej so that
	     EXPSCORR processing of individual exposures runs to completion in
             the event wf3rej is not able to produce a crj_tmp product.

 15-Mar-2011: CALWF3 2.3: Implemented the following PRs:

  65151/560: Include calculation of MEANDARK in IR darkcorr.
  64963/545: Reordered UVIS processing steps so that wf32d runs after wf3rej,
	     so that CR flags produced by wf3rej show up in wf32d flt images.
  64854/536: Reordered IR processing steps so that nlincorr and saturation
             checking get performed before dark subtraction.

 27-Apr-2010: wf3rej version 27-Apr-2010; version 2.1
  64941/544: Fix parsing of wf3rej crsigmas param string to allow embedded

  63806/459: Fixed the IR CRCORR (up-the-ramp fitting) routine to properly
             set the output DQ flag values in the FLT image. Pixels that
             had all samples rejected for any reason were all being given
             a SATURATED flag value instead of the actual input flags.

 26-Oct-2009: CALWF3 1.8: Implemented the following PRs:
  63788/458: Upgraded the UVIS and IR FLATCORR routines to use the mean gain
             value of all 4 amps when performing the gain calibration. This
             avoids double correction for amp-to-amp gain offsets, which are
             already included in the flatfield reference images.

 14-Oct-2009: CALWF3 1.7: Implemented the following PRs:
  63556/454: Upgraded the IR CRCORR routine to use the DQ mask value from

 13-Mar-2009: CALWF3 1.3: Implemented the following tickets:
  352: Implemented use of CRREJTAB in IR CRCORR to retreive CR rejection
       threshold, instead of having it hardwired in the code.
  365: Fixed logic in IR CRCORR to correctly identify pixels that are saturated
       in first read to then use value of zero read.
  376: Fixed IR CRCORR routine to compute output values for pixels with only
       one good sample.
  377: Fixed computation of output SAMP and TIME values in IR CRCORR routine.
  378: Fixed UVIS BIASCORR routine to take serial virtual overscan columns into
       account when computing subarray offsets in bias reference image
  381: Change IR CRCORR to no longer set ZEROSIG in FLT file DQ array, and
       use UNSTABLE DQ value to mark high curvature pixels.

 20-Feb-2009: CALWF3 1.2a: Implemented the following PRs/Tickets:
  62005/348: WF3REJ routine fixed to properly flag all rejected pixels

  61698/321: UVIS BLEVCORR fixed to properly handle rejected overscan rows/cols
  61741/323: Update to DQ flag assignments
  61819/327: Fixed/modified the behavior of CR & SPILL flagging in wf3rej

 10-Oct-2008: CALWF3 1.1   Updated wf3ccd/blevcorr to reject outliers from the
			   parallel overscan fit, as is done for the serial fit.
			   Fixed calwf3/procccd so that it finishes EXPSCORR
			   processing and deletes blv_tmp's afterwards.
			   Fixed wf32d/doflat so that gain conversion only gets
			   applied once.
			   Convert IR data to electrons in flatcorr step.
			   Added skysub="mean" capability to wf3rej.

 11-Sep-2008: CALWF3 1.0   Updated wf3ir/nlincorr to use third-order coeffs.
			   Also updated wf3ir/blevcorr to use robust mean of all
			   ref pixels for each readout, rather than
			   quad-by-quad corrections.

 28-Aug-2008: CALWF3 0.99  Change dummy drizzle product file name suffix from
                           "dth" to "drz". Fixed IR gain and readnoise values
			   used in wf3rej. Upgraded IR noiscalc to use separate
			   gain & readnoise values for each amp quadrant. Enable
			   processing of exptime=0 images in wf3rej. Fix use of
			   amp-dependent readnoise values in wf3rej.

 21-Jul-2008: CALWF3 0.95  Updated IR cridcalc routine to use new CR methods
                           developed by the NICMOS group as implemented in

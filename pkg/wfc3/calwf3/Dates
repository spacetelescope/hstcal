25-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - changed pow() to powf() in the readnoise calculation to deal with memory overrun producing nans in some cases

24-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - updated the mac os version check in wscript to use sw_vers, the old way was returning junk and we need it for adding the 64bit flags to the compile
    - added some initializations the clang compiler complained about

20-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - I changed a float to double in wf3cte readnoise section for added precision
    - moved GetGlobalInfo and checkGlobal info higher in the code to reject non-wfc3 datasets
    - moved a delete section further out in the logic and that seemed to fix #1220, tests on cte and non-cte data seemed happy

18-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - BuildDthInput has to create the input filename from the asn root, but this can be either FLT or FLC now, have to figure out which one to use.
    - Had to add separate DTH pass for IR data and double DTH pass for UVIS data because the input filename for RPTCORR/EXPCORR associations are built in the code from the data rootnames in the ASN table. So the UVIS data coming out of procccd has to take a double pass through DTH when PCTECORR is PERFORM.
    - changed the checking order for subarrays in the PCTECORR routine so that it errors out cleanly (has to do with 1 group of images for subarrays)
    - added the check for INSTRUMENT == WFC3 back to the code, actually related to a user complainging that calwf3 didn't tell them it couldn't reduce ACS data.
    - had to update the procir call to wf3rej_0 signature for the asn update I added to uvis
    - updated the mainrej.e calls which were segfaulting (calling wf3rej standalone on input list of images)
    - added dynamic memory allocation for trailer file list to initrejtrl
    - updated text in wf3rej to report that Astrodrizzle should be used to align images instead of PyDrizzle since that's how it's advertised to users 
    - found a problem (even in the released version of calwf3) with output file for associations with multiple products, created #1220

12-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - fix for #1215 binned data detection for sink pixel seg faults

11-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -REJ_RATE reported consistently now with nrej initialized in wf3rej
    -fix for #1216, the BIACFILE name was not being populated for bias images with BIASCORR == OMIT
    -I also went ahead and added a clean exit for images going to PCTECORR which already have BIASCORR complete

5-Aug-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -More fixes related to pipeline changes added, see #1193 for details

21-July-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    -Debugged version of the CTE code committed.
    -see #1193 ticket for extensive changes
        
31-May-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    The first version of UVIS2, including the CTE, Sink Pixel, and photometry changes.
    
08-Dec-2014 - MLS -- Version 3.2.1 
    The FLUXCORR step has been updated, changing how the data is processed in the flow of the pipeline. It was discovered that
    a chain of requirements meant that the values from the IMPHTTAB were not being read or updated correctly. This is a multifold
    problem which starts with the way that the IMPHTTAB is read and how it is constructed. Since the file, and it's calling functions,
    are common to all instruments, the best way around it was to move where the fluxcorr step was done in the pipeline to OUTSIDE the
    main wf32d loop. The step then reads in the FLT file which was written out and updates the SCI,1 data and headers with the photometry keyword
    information.    

09-Dec-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.2
    A new calibration step was added to the UVIS process, FLUXCORR, can now be run at the end of regular
    processing. It will scale the chip2 image using the new PHTFLAM1 and PHTFLAM2 values in the IMPHTAB.
    New flatfields for all filters, as well as a new IMPHTTAB will be delivered by the team for this step
    to be completely implemented. This is a significant version increase since I had to modify the globablly
    access GetPhotTab to read the new WFC3 imphttab correctly, as well as touch many routines in the calwf3 process.

15-Nov-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.6
    Fixed a file i/o issue after change in cfitsio interaction (see #970, #1073 and #1069)

30-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.5
    1049: Fixed the individual task executables for wf3ir, wf3ccd, wf32d to properly used the user 
    specfied output filename when they are called standalone
    
09-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.4
    983: Updated the postflash routine and sub1d and multk1d to perform the correct subarray
    calibration for all cases. The previous update was not sufficient for team subarrays.
    
26-Mar-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.3
    Updated the postflash routine to apply the correct offset for all amps
    when a user specified subarray is used (no GO users are allowed to do this)
  
    Some unrelated files will change because I formatted the indentation to make
    the code easier to decipher

11-Feb-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.2
    Updated the bias subtraction to check for CCDAMP values of SINGLE_AMP and
    SINGLE_OR_ALL in the reference bias file image when a full frame reference file
    and a  user specified subarray are used so that the correct overscan region is ignored

    Removed check for TDFTRANS per team request, see #980, I'm keeping the same version as
    the previous change because I havent delivered it yet

    Added correct pixel offset for subarray images taken with amp B or D for post-flash corretion

2-Jan-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.1
    File I/O in acsrej updated to avoid problems with CFITSIO upcasting  
    file permissions to read/write when not needed. This will allow the 
    hstio code to remove logic that allowed the old code to work but  
    caused problems for CADC when CFITSIO opened ref files in read/write  
    mode because of that hstio logic. 

31-Dec-2012 ML versions 3.1
            fixed TrlBufInit bug, the init in the trlbuf structure wasn't being set to 1 on int
            causing calwf3 to always abort after the check message was added. 
28-Dec-2012 ML Version 3.1
            Updated to account for a memory leak on linux machines during BuildDth 
             when RPTCORR is off and a new spt is being constructed (#967)

27-Jan-2012: CALWF3 2.6.2: Decreased max number of images to be combined in
             wf3rej from 250 to 120 because OPUS is still getting errors

24-Jan-2012: CALWF3 2.6.1: Updated procir.c to check for the number of images,
             because there were singletons coming through OPUS that had
             RPTCORR=PERFRORM, which were failing when calwf3 tried to
             apply wf3rej.

15-Dec-2011: CALWF3 2.6: Implemented the following PRs:

  65151/560: Include calculation of MEANDARK in IR darkcorr.
  64963/545: Reordered UVIS processing steps so that wf32d runs after wf3rej,
	     so that CR flags produced by wf3rej show up in wf32d flt images.
  64854/536: Reordered IR processing steps so that nlincorr and saturation
             checking get performed before dark subtraction.

  63806/459: Fixed the IR CRCORR (up-the-ramp fitting) routine to properly
             set the output DQ flag values in the FLT image. Pixels that
             had all samples rejected for any reason were all being given
             a SATURATED flag value instead of the actual input flags.

 26-Oct-2009: CALWF3 1.8: Implemented the following PRs:
  63788/458: Upgraded the UVIS and IR FLATCORR routines to use the mean gain
             value of all 4 amps when performing the gain calibration. This
             avoids double correction for amp-to-amp gain offsets, which are
             already included in the flatfield reference images.

       threshold, instead of having it hardwired in the code.
  365: Fixed logic in IR CRCORR to correctly identify pixels that are saturated
       in first read to then use value of zero read.
  376: Fixed IR CRCORR routine to compute output values for pixels with only
       one good sample.
  377: Fixed computation of output SAMP and TIME values in IR CRCORR routine.
  378: Fixed UVIS BIASCORR routine to take serial virtual overscan columns into
       account when computing subarray offsets in bias reference image
  381: Change IR CRCORR to no longer set ZEROSIG in FLT file DQ array, and
       use UNSTABLE DQ value to mark high curvature pixels.

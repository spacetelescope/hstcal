### 18-Oct-2023 - MDD - Version 3.7.1
    - Updates to reconcile the old and new algorithms for flagging full-well saturated pixels.  
      The new algorithm uses a saturation image which is applied after BLECORR/BIASCORR, and
      the image is already trimmed of the overscan regions. The old algorithm used a single
      scalar value applied to the ENTIRE readout (science data and overscan).  Added flagging 
      in DQICORR of the overscan regions when the saturation image of the new algorithm is to 
      be applied later in the processing.

### 08-Jun-2023 - MDD - Version 3.7.0
    - Implementation to use an image to detect and flag full-well saturation versus a simple scalar.
      The new routine, dofwsat.c, is similar to what has been done for calacs. The WFC3 implementation
      is more complicated in that there are serial virtual overscan columns, as well as binned images,
      to accommodate.  The detection/flagging occurs after blev and bias corrections while the output is
      still in counts.  If the SATUFILE keyword is missing from the FITS header, or the keyword does
      not have a valid filename as a value, the code will revert to using the original method of flagging
      full-well saturation.  The flagging will be done in doDQI and use a single value as the saturation 
      threshold.

### 27-May-2021 - MDD - Version 3.6.2
    - Bug fix to address calwf3.e crashing (Abort trap: 6) when taking an existing *_ima.fits (IR) file
      (produced with FLATCORR=PERFORM and CRCORR=OMIT) with CRCORR set to PERFORM. This reentrant
      processing is fundamental to being able to remove the variable IR background during the course
      of an exposure. Problem: char variable declared too small to hold its largest possible contents.

### 28-Apr-2021 - MDD - Version 3.6.1
    - Bug fix to address a problem detected when processing a Tungsten flat with a high background.
      Uninitialized values were used for further computation causing an eventual exception.

### 31-Dec-2020 - MDD - Version 3.6.0
    - Implementation of a significantly upgraded CTE correction as defined/derived by J. Anderson.
      The upgraded CTE algorithm is also streamlined and executes faster then the previous version.

### 12-Aug-2020 - MDD - Version 3.5.2
    - Added MJD as a parameterized variable for the PHOTMODE keyword to
      enable a time-dependent photometric correction for the UVIS only.
    - Fixed a bug in the IMPHTTAB package to support properly data with 
      multiple imsets, in conjunction with a parameterized value.

### 24-Jun-2020 - MDD - Version 3.5.1
    - Replaced/modified routines based upon copyright numerical recipes routines.
      Updates implemented Oct 2019, but installation delayed for higher priority updates.

### 14-Oct-2018 - JAN/MDD - Version 3.5.0
    - Bug fixes to the CTE correction to fix out of bounds memory access and remove unnecessary critical section.

### 19-Jan-2018 - JAN/MDD - Version 3.4.2
    - A number of code robustness improvements (address memory leaks, fix detected bugs) were implemented.

### 10-Apr-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Fixed missed init for header vars in cte code

### 02-Apr-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Fixed logic brackets in subarray prescan bias call which didn't explicitly do the gain correction in the if loop, see Issue #55
    - Fixed double statement, see Issue #63

### 27-Mar-2017 - MLS - Version 3.4.1
    - Update photometry keyword descriptions in UVIS

### 28-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Fixed memory allocation around one more print

### 26-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Fixed memory allocation around prints

### 20-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Moved the init for the CTE params back to the top of the code, it had gotten moved below the header update for the information

### 14-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - CTE subarrays enabled for user supported subarrays with physical overscan

### 06-Sep-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - Sink pixel flagging for subarray appears correct now

### 18-July-2016 - MLS - Version 3.4
    - CTE and Sink Pixel implementation for subarrays submitted by Brechmos for review

### 28-Jan-2016 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Removed the call to WF3Dth for the CTE data. This is essentially useless since the DTH step has been replaced with astrodrizzle, the only function it has it to concatina
te the SPT files from the association members into a new spt file with the product/subproduct name. This is already done for the non-cte processed data, there is no difference
 between the cte and non-cte SPT files, they are only related to the RAW input file.

### 22-Jan-2016 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Noticed I missed renaming the crc file with the call to WF3DTH and was setting the input to the crj suffix, but also needed updates to GetAsnTable to include crc filename population for subproducts and sending the correct subproduct through processing, it was always using crj
    - some code cleanup as I went
    - trailer file concatination update, but it's still not entirely correct

### 19-Jan-2016 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Updates to fix trailer file output information. Part of the problem is the change in name of the output RAC_TMP file, the functions which create input and output trailer file naming conventions look for the dot to separate extensions so I need to change some expectations.
    - Update to check for the raw header value of PCTENSMD and update the cte parameter table accordingly (though only a value of 0 is valid right now)

### 08-Jan-2016 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - changed the name of the output rac file to rac_tmp so that archive could handle deleting it better

### 05-Nov-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - removed explicit downcasts and added calloc returns in procccd

### 04-Nov-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - add more explicity initializations where I could find them

### 24-Oct-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - The nightly build is specifying a higher level of optimization through to the compiler than the debug mode that I have been using for my testing. Building calwf3 with the lower optimization produced no errors or warnings and ran through cleanly, but the high optimization brought on a segfault inside the CTE code in the first openmp section. This was only happening on the Linux cluster, the MAC builds showed no issue. I went back 2 versions of the wf3cte.c code and redid the changes by hand step by step. The problem area seemed to be a set of arrays which would rather be doubles than floats. I also changed the remaining floats to doubles, where I could, and removed more of the memcpy statements, making them regular array assignments. These things seem to have cleared the issues, and hopefully preventing new ones for now.
    - I also removed a superfluous openmp print statement from maincte.c and cleaned up some more informational print statements.
    - I added a time measurement, with verbose on the code prints how long the CTE section took to run, with the specification of number of threads/cpus.


### 21-Oct-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Editing text for the screen and trailer files
    - Formally removed the rac file before the routine ends since archive isn't expecting it

### 16-Oct-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
   - machine dependent bug, some images were getting nan values on linux machines
    - I also removed the temporary image saves we were using for the CTE routines

### 29-Sep-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - bug in original fortran code fixed; the final RAC image should be made by subtracting the CHG image (the net cte effect) from the original non-BIC subtracted raw data. This should remove the additional bias signature that Matthew was seeing in the stacked dark frames. It should NOT make a significant change in the overall output of the code since bias levels are low to begin with.

    - I also changed the way the code uses the SCLBYCOL reference file (as called in Jays fortran). The way the fortran code is structured, the reference file information never actually gets used in the calculation. This doesn't make a numerical difference at the moment because the reference file values are all ones, ie. there is no additional scaling done on the CTE pixel other than by using the CTE scaling fraction and the column location. However, if the science team ever delivers a new reference file which has these values updated, they wont actually get used by the code unless this change is implemented.

   - Reformatted some code for readability, and fixed SEGFAULT error in reference file checking when iref environment variable not set by user, so can't find file (also when can't find file in general). I made RefExist exit clean the first time it found a missing file, HSTIO was barfing any other way.

### 24-Sep-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - fix for machine dependent precision bug

### 03-Sep-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - One more precision change needed for the nans in the readnoise section

### 28-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - These updates appear to fix the nan issue in the readnoise step that we ran into with some images
    - I also made the cte code a bit more tidy and organized

### 25-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - changed pow() to powf() in the readnoise calculation to deal with memory overrun producing nans in some cases

### 24-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - updated the mac os version check in wscript to use sw_vers, the old way was returning junk and we need it for adding the 64bit flags to the compile
    - added some initializations the clang compiler complained about

### 20-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - I changed a float to double in wf3cte readnoise section for added precision
    - moved GetGlobalInfo and checkGlobal info higher in the code to reject non-wfc3 datasets
    - moved a delete section further out in the logic and that seemed to fix #1220, tests on cte and non-cte data seemed happy

### 18-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - BuildDthInput has to create the input filename from the asn root, but this can be either FLT or FLC now, have to figure out which one to use.
    - Had to add separate DTH pass for IR data and double DTH pass for UVIS data because the input filename for RPTCORR/EXPCORR associations are built in the code from the data rootnames in the ASN table. So the UVIS data coming out of procccd has to take a double pass through DTH when PCTECORR is PERFORM.
    - changed the checking order for subarrays in the PCTECORR routine so that it errors out cleanly (has to do with 1 group of images for subarrays)
    - added the check for INSTRUMENT == WFC3 back to the code, actually related to a user complainging that calwf3 didn't tell them it couldn't reduce ACS data.
    - had to update the procir call to wf3rej_0 signature for the asn update I added to uvis
    - updated the mainrej.e calls which were segfaulting (calling wf3rej standalone on input list of images)
    - added dynamic memory allocation for trailer file list to initrejtrl
    - updated text in wf3rej to report that Astrodrizzle should be used to align images instead of PyDrizzle since that's how it's advertised to users
    - found a problem (even in the released version of calwf3) with output file for associations with multiple products, created #1220

### 12-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - fix for #1215 binned data detection for sink pixel seg faults

### 11-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - WF3Rej for IR images, REJ_RATE reported in header wrong because nrej wasn't being initialized, see #1214
    - fix for #1216, the BIACFILE name was not being populated for bias images with BIASCORR == OMIT
    - I also went ahead and added a clean exit for images going to PCTECORR which already have BIASCORR complete

### 05-Aug-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Updates related to #1193, #1205
    - Clean up of getphttab.c file for unused variables
    - Clean up function references and unused variables in wfc3 code
    - photometry keyword update in all headers (#1101 addition) except for the remaining team decisions and how to deal with photplam and photbw-
    - photfnu is now calculated based on the chip value for phtflam[chip]
    - fix for association trailer file naming and concatination, see #1209
    - removed reference to save_crj because it really was just save_tmp
    - fix for crj tmp files not being removed when asked to delete

###  22-Jul-2015 MLS -- Version 3.3
    - Full-frame CTE correction for UVIS images is enabled. This can be run stand-alone by calling wf3cte.e and turned on and off using the PCTECORR switch. Many new reference files were created and delivered to be used with this step and users should re-retrieve their raw datasets from the archive to make sure they get the most up-to-date science and reference files.
    - Photometry scaling via the FLUXCORR step is fully implemented. New reference files were created and delivered to be used with this step and users should re-retrieve their raw datasets from the archive to make sure they get the most up-to-date science and reference files.
    - The pipeline now runs twice by default, once with the CTE correction on and once with the CTE correction off. All output files are saved with *??c specifiers when the CTE correction has been applied to the data.
    - The CTE portion of the pipeline can be run with or without multithreading turned on. Having it on will greatly speed up the processing time for multicore machines.
    - As a separate step which is keyed on DQICORR, pixels in the science image which can be identified as sink pixels  (See ISR WFC3-2014-19) will be marked in the DQ extension of the output image. Sink pixel flagging will take place whether or not CTE correction is done. The header keyword which contains the sink pixel reference file is SNKCFILE, sink pixels are flagged in the rotated amp read format that the CTE correction also uses.
    - The default CRCORR behavior for IR SCAN data has been changed. It will now be omitted by default so that the resulting calibrated image is first-last instead of the fit to the ramp
    - All IR scan related keywords formerly in the SPT file will also be present in the FLT file.
    - For UVIS and IR, a copy of the CSMID keyword, formerly in the SPT file will also be in the FLT ile, CSMID lists the channel select mechanism ID.
    - see #1193 for extensive changes

### 31-May-2015 - MLS -- Version 3.3
    UVIS 2.0 added to pipeline, including CTE, Sink Pixel and Photometry updates.

### 08-Dec-2014 - MLS -- Version 3.2.1
    The FLUXCORR step has been updated, changing how the data is processed in the flow of the pipeline. It was discovered that
    a chain of requirements meant that the values from the IMPHTTAB were not being read or updated correctly. This is a multifold
    problem which starts with the way that the IMPHTTAB is read and how it is constructed. Since the file, and it's calling functions,
    are common to all instruments, the best way around it was to move where the fluxcorr step was done in the pipeline to OUTSIDE the
    main wf32d loop. The step then reads in the FLT file which was written out and updates the SCI,1 data and headers with the photometry keyword
    information.


### 09-Dec-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.2
    A new calibration step was added to the UVIS process, FLUXCORR, can now be run at the end of regular
    processing. It will scale the chip2 image using the new PHTFLAM1 and PHTFLAM2 values in the IMPHTAB.
    New flatfields for all filters, as well as a new IMPHTTAB will be delivered by the team for this step
    to be completely implemented. This is a significant version increase since I had to modify the globablly
    access GetPhotTab to read the new WFC3 imphttab correctly, as well as touch many routines in the calwf3 process.
    (#1011 is the main ticket)


### 15-Niv-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.6
    Fixed a file i/o issue after change in cfitsio interaction (see #970, #1073 and #1069)

### 30-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.5
    - fixed the individual task executables for wf3ir, wf3ccd, wf32d to properly used the user specfied output filename
      when they are called standalone
      (#1049)

### 09-Sept-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.4
    Updated the postflash routine and sub1d and multk1d to perform the correct subarray
    calibration for all cases. (#983) The previous update was not sufficient for team subarrays.

### 26-Mar-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.3
    Updated the postflash routine to apply the correct offset for all amps
    when a user specified subarray is used (no GO users are allowed to do this)

    Some unrelated files will change because I formatted the indentation to make
    the code easier to decipher


### 11-Feb-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.2
    Updated the bias subtraction to check for CCDAMP values of SINGLE_AMP and
    SINGLE_OR_ALL in the reference bias file image when a full frame reference file
    and a  user specified subarray are used so that the correct overscan region is ignored

    Removed check for TDFTRANS per team request, see #980, I'm keeping the same version as
    the previous change because I havent delivered it yet

    Added correct pixel offset for subarray images taken with amp B or D for post-flash corretion


### 2-Jan-2013 - MLS -- Version 3.1.1
    File I/O in acsrej updated to avoid problems with CFITSIO upcasting
    file permissions to read/write when not needed. This will allow the
    hstio code to remove logic that allowed the old code to work but
    caused problems for CADC when CFITSIO opened ref files in read/write
    mode because of that hstio logic.

###31 Dec 2012 - MLS - Version 3.1
    - fixed TrlInitBuf problem so that it initializes correcty (r21162)
###28 Dec 2012 -MLS - Version 3.1
    - Updated to account for a memory leak on linux machines during BuildDth
      when RPTCORR is off and a new spt is being constructed (#967)
######### HST CAL DELIVERED ########

###15 Nov 2012 - HSTCAL delivered to opus for use in the pipeline

### 18Oct 2012 - MLS - Version 2.7.1
       949:  fixed a memory leak in cridcalc that was occuring on linux machines
             and only affected IR data.

### 21 May 2012 - MLS -- Version 2.6.4
    - small fix in for the negative cosmic rays
      modified the cridcalc rejection settings for spike so that those
      pixels were not excluded from the CR detection algorithm
      removed the case dependency for the BUNIT keyword
      changed the BUNIT keyvalue to write ELECTRONS instead of electrons
      new option added "-r" to calwf3 to print the current verison and exit
    -changed "electrons" to "ELECTRONS" to be consistent, also there are places
    in the code that are doing a case sensative check. I'm going to try and make
    those case insensitive as well
    -updated the BUNIT keyword code in cr_scaling.c to be case insensitive
    -added "-r" option to calwf3 to report the software version and exit cleanly
   - Use zero read pixel value for WF3 IR ramp fitting when saturated

### 23 Mar 2012 - HAB -- Version 2.6.3
    - Fixed the IR processing flow so that an association-level trailer file
      is created even when a CRJ sub-product is not created by wf3rej.

### 27 Jan 2012 - MLS -- Version 2.6.2
    - Decreased the max number of images to combine in wf3rej back to 120
      because OPUS is still getting errors

### 23 Jan 2012 - MLS -- Version 2.6.1
    - Modified procir.c to check for the number of images, to account
      for singletons going through the pipeline with RPTCORR=PERFORM, which
      caused calwf3 to fail when trying to run wf3rej.

### 15 Dec 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.6
    - Upgraded wf3rej to properly handle input data that are in units of count rates.

### 09 Dec 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.5.1
    - Modified the high-level IR processing logic so that rptcorr processing
      is only applied when RPTCORR=PERFORM in the image header.

### 01 Oct 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.5
    - Fixed the cridcalc step to correctly accumulate the total integration
      time of the valid samples for each pixel in some unusual cases.
    - Increased max image combine limit in wf3rej from 120 to 250.

### 02 Aug 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.4.1
    - Updated lib/wf3info.c to have CheckGain always close the ref image before
      returning.
    - Updated wf3ir/cridcalc.c to have crrej free memory for tot_ADUs array
      before returning.

### 17 Jun 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.4
    - Updated wf3rej/wf3rej.c and calwf3/procccd.c so that they handle error
      returns from wf3rej in a way that allows for EXPSCORR processing of
      individual exposures to complete.

### 15 Mar 2011 - HAB -- Version 2.3
    - Updated CopyFFile routine to update FILENAME keyword in output file.
    - Modified zsigcorr to no longer rely on effective exposure time of zeroth
      read image.

### 01 Dec 2010 - HAB -- Version 2.2
    - Updated tabpedigree routine to not return error status when a ref
      table can't be opened, so that calling routines can issue missing
      reference file error messages before shutting down.
    - Updated the GetIRRef routine in getreffiles.c to check all IR cal
      switches and correctly handle re-entrant IR processing.
    - Updated the logic in several routines that handle processing of
      crj sub-products and their trailer files so that no attempt is made to
      produce a sub-product when all but 1 member is missing.
    - Updated IR ZSIGCORR to not skip processing of flagged pixels.

### 15 May 2010 - HAB -- Version 2.1
    - Updated the order of UVIS processing so that wf32d runs after
      crcorr (instead of before), so that final flt images have CR flags
      from crcorr.
    - Updated the order of IR processing so that nlincorr runs before
      darkcorr. This allows saturation checking to be performed on darks.
    - Added the computation of MEANDARK in IR darkcorr routine.

### 27 Apr 2010 - HAB -- wf3rej version 27-Apr-2010; version 2.1
    - Modified the wf3rej cl script and parameter parsing so that it no
      no longer stops with a syntax error if there are embedded blanks in
      the crsigmas param string.

### 08 Mar 2010 - HAB -- Version 2.0
    - Updated the UVIS and IR flatcorr routines to use the mean gain value
      when performing gain calibration for all images, including grisms.
      Amp-dependent gain offsets are now included in the grism flats.
    - Updated the lib/mkspt.c routine to not shutdown if none of the input
      spt files are present.
    - Eliminated the creation of dummy drz products.
    - Fixed the IR sampzero computation for sub-array exposures.
    - Reworked IR zsigcorr to properly flag saturated pixels in zeroth and
      first reads.
    - Upgraded IR cridcalc to properly compute output ERR values.

### 27 Oct 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.8.1
    - Fixed the IR CRCORR routine to assign output DQ flag values for pixels
      with all samples rejected based on the logical OR of all input flags.

### 26 Oct 2009 - HAB -- Verison 1.8
    - Updated GetCCDTab to compute the mean gain value for use in flatcorr.
    - Updated the UVIS and IR flatcorr routines to use the mean gain value
      when performing gain calibration, except for grism images, which still
      use the amp-dependent gain values.

### 14 Oct 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.7
    - Updated IR cridcalc to use "badinpdq" value from CRREJTAB as DQ
      mask value for rejecting samples, rather than hardwiring DQIGNORE
      to a constant in the code.
    - Updated the crrpar_in routine in wf3ir/refdata.c to report the value
      of badinpdq, now that it's being used in cridcalc.

### 17 Aug 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.6
    - Updated IR flatcorr to set BUNIT to "electrons" after applying gain
      correction.
    - Updated several routines to set NEXTEND to correct values for IR
      association drz, crj, and spt products.

### 24 Jun 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.5
    - Fixed a bug in the WF3REJ routine that was causing it to crash when
      processing repeat-obs associations of IR subarray images, due to the
      use of ampx/ampy values that were only valid for full-frame.

### 27 Apr 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.4.1
    - Fixed a bug in the UVIS BLEVCORR routine that was causing it to crash
      when processing some amp B/D subarray images, due to the overscan column
      limits going out of bounds on the science image array.

### 14 Apr 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.4
    - Fixed bugs in UVIS FLATCORR that was causing it to crash when applying a
      binned LFLTFILE. Also enabled use of an LFLTFILE that has the same size
      as the science image (and therefore no interpolation required).
    - Upgraded the algorithms in the resistant mean routine to use double
      precision in calculations involving the mean and standard deviation. This
      routine is used by wf3rej when skysub=mean and by the IR BLEVCORR step.
    - Fixed a bug in the IR refdata module that reads the crrejtab info, so
      that it now correctly identifies rows where IRRAMP=yes.

### 13 Mar 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.3
    - Implemented use of CRREJTAB in IR CRCORR to get rejection parameters
    - Fixed many bugs in IR CRCORR, including computation of output SAMP and
      TIME values, and also changed flagging of HIGH_CURVATURE to UNSTABLE, and
      removed ZEROSIG flags from FLT file DQ array.
    - Fixed UVIS BIASCORR to take serial virtual overscan columns into account
      when computing subarray offsets in bias ref image.

### 20 Feb 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.2a
    - Modified wf3rej/rej_loop so that SPILL pixels get tested to see if they
      qualify as a CR.

### 29 Jan 2009 - HAB -- Version 1.2
    - Modified wf3rej/rej_loop to only write CR flag values into outputs (no
      SPILL values) and to not flag pixels as CR in output crj file if there
      were 1 or more good samples for the pixel.
    - Added checking of FILETYPE and other applicable parameters such as
      DETECTOR, GAIN, FILTER for all ref files. This involved updates to
      several routines.
    - Modified wf3dq.h and all places within code where DQ macros are used to
      implement new UVIS and IR flag assignments.
    - Fixed bug in lib/trlbuf.c that was causing segv when trying to close
      a nonexistent file.
    - Added computation of PHOTFNU to UVIS photcorr step and modified syntax
      of PHOTMODE keywords to use both UVIS1 and UVIS2 for UVIS exposures, use
      CAL for UVIS exposures, and eliminate use of DN for IR.
    - Upgraded the UVIS blevcorr fitting routines to guard against the case
      where many bias row/col entries are rejected as bad.
    - Fixed IR cridcalc routine to reinstate code that was missing from the
      calnica port, which flags CRs in all samples following the hit.
    - Fixed wf3ir/dqicorr to handle missing CCDGAIN/CCDAMP columns in BPIXTAB.
    - Fixed bug in wf3ir/zsigcorr to compute correct effective exposure time
      of zeroth read subarray images.

      array access for subarray images.

### 10 Oct 2008 - HAB -- Version 1.1
    - Modified wf3ccd/blevcorr to reject outliers from parallel overscan
      values using new cleanDriftFit routine. Also optimized clipping
      thresholds for both serial and parallel fits. Modifications to doblev.c,
      blevfit.c, and blevdrift.c.
    - Modified calwf3/procccd.c to fix EXPSCORR handling and save_tmp settings
      for deleting blv_tmp's after EXPSCORR is done.
    - Modified wf32d/doflat.c so that gain conversion only gets applied once
      in calls to divFlat for PFLT and DFLT applications.
    - Upgraded wf3ir/flatcorr.c to convert data to units of electrons by
      multiplying by the gain after flat field has been applied.
    - Added capabilities to wf3rej/rej_sky.c to compute "mean" sky value, using
      resistant mean method.

### 11 Sep 2008 - HAB -- Version 1.0
    - Modified wf3ir/nlincorr algorithms to use third-order coeff arrays,
      which involved changes to wf3info.h (for NlinData struct), refdata.c,
      and nlincorr.c.
    - Modified wf3ir/blevcorr to use new resistant-mean calculation of ref
      pix statistics and to perform correction globally for each readout,
      rather than quad-by-quad. Uses new statistics module "resistmean.c".

### 28 Aug 2008 - HAB -- Version 0.99
    - Changed dummy drizzle product file name suffix from "dth" to "drz" in
      several modules (calwf3/wf3init.c, calwf3/wf3table.c, lib/findroot.c,
      lib/mkspt.c).
    - Updated get_nsegn gain routine (lib/detnsegn.c) to properly handle IR
      gain and readnoise values for use in wf3rej.
    - Updated wf3ir/noiscalc to use separate gain & readnoise values for each
      amp quadrant.
    - Fixed bug in wf3rej/rej_do.c that was not allowing a group of
      exptime=0 images (e.g. biases) to process.
    - Fixed bug in wf3rej/rej_init.c that was causing amp A readnoise value to
      be used for all image quadrants.

### 21 Jul 2008 - MS  -- Version 0.95
    - Ported new CR rejection methods from calnica to wf3ir/cridcalc.c.

      into a crj product.
    - Added capability to calwf3/wf3dth.c to create dummy dth products, until
      MultiDrizzle becomes available in WFC3 pipeline.
    - Various updates to wf3rej routines to properly handle WFC3 IR images.

### 21 Dec 2007 - HAB -- Version 0.8

      available for MultiDrizzle CR's (for consistency with ACS).
    - Use upgraded FirstLast routine in lib/dodqi.c to fix indexing problems
      associated with binned images.
    - Upgraded lib/mkspt.c to correctly handle structure of WFC3 SPT files,
      most noteably the SNAP1 extension.
    - Modified wf3ir/blevcorr.c to remove the swapping of quad indexes for old
      images, because all old images have been reprocessed and rotated to
      proper orientation.
    - Upgraded wf3rej/rej_init.c, rej_loop.c and rej_sky.c to prevent crashing
      of getShortLine routine on input null DQ arrays.

### 01 Aug 2006 - HAB -- Version 0.61
    - Modified wf3ccd/doblev.c to select correct readnoise value when
      processing one- or two-amp readouts, and to convert the readnoise
      value to units of DN's to match science image units.
    - Modified wf3ir/blevcorr.c to swap the quad indexes around for
      images processed before and after the date on which OPUS started
      transposing IR raw images.
    - Upgraded wf3ir/math.c adiv and adiv_noref routines to avoid
      divide by zero errors.
    - Switched wf3ir/flatcorr.c routine from multiplying by (inverse)
      flat to dividing by flat.

### 17 Jul 2006 - HAB -- Version 0.6

      account for the presence of serial virtual overscan in raw image space.
    - CALACS-derived changes:
    - Removed use of "updateAsnStat" routine in calwf3/calwf3.c, because
      only OPUS should update the ASN_STAT keyword in the asn table.
    - Fixed problem printing list of wf3rej input file names in
      calwf3/procccd.c.
    - Added check for null ("") ref file names in calwf3/refexist.c.

    - Modified wf3ir/noiscalc.c to fix bug in noise computation.

### 15 Feb 2005 - HAB -- Version 0.4
    - Modified wf3ccd/findover.c routine to select oscntab row based on
      image size (nx,ny) instead of binning when processing IR images.
    - Modified wf3ir/blevcorr.c routine to use biassect values from oscntab
      to set limits for reference pixel region analysis, instead of using
      image trim values.
    - Fixed memory reallocation problem in wf3rej/wf3rej.c InitRejTrl routine,
      which was causing routine to crash on very large number of input images.

### 20 Feb 2004 - HAB -- Version 0.3
    - (OPR 50441)
    - Fixed use of amp boundaries in 'donoise.c' to take into account
      presence of WFC3 serial virtual overscan columns.
    - Fixed 'getccdtab.c', 'getgrp.c', and 'getkeys.c' routines to properly
      handle binned science images.
    - CALACS-derived changes:
    - Fixed memory allocation bug in wf3rej/rej_loop.c to handle image sizes
      not evenly divisible by 8.
    - Removed SCALENSE from the computation of the error image in WF3REJ.
    - Implemented A-TO-D saturation flagging in 'dodqi.c' as an additional
      flag for saturation.
    - Implemented 2-stage clipping in computation of bias value from overscan
      columns in 'doblev.c'. First stage will be limited to 3*sigma or
      3*sqrt(mean), whichever is less, while second stage will be limited
      to 3*readnoise.
    - Modified 'dodqi.c' to reduce CCDAMP and CCDGAIN from being required
      columns in the BPIXTAB to being optional.

### 28 Oct 2003 - HAB -- Version 0.2
    - (OPR 49720)
    - Changed all handling of commanded gain values (ccdgain) from int to
      float data type in all applicable routines.
    - Fixes to UVIS subarray overscan handling, including the use of serial
      physical overscan regions (instead of serial virtual, which doesn't
      exist for subarrays), and the proper trimming of overscan region(s) for
      output images.
    - UVIS processing handles RPT-OBS images exactly the same as CR-SPLITs
      (i.e. sends them to WF3Rej instead of WF3Sum).
    - IR processing loads DARK and NLIN switch and ref file info for use
      by ZSIGCORR (in case ZSIG is performed without DARK or NLIN). Also
      changed ZSIG and NLIN steps to use just 1 node array (saturation level)
      from NLIN ref file (no more node that specifies lower bound for nlin
      correction like NICMOS does).
    - CALACS changes: Implement use of EXPSCORR switch; Added sigma clipping
      to bias fitting; Added processing msgs for reporting bias fit slope and
      intercept; Fixed use of default bias levels for each amp as retrieved
      from CCDTAB; WF3Rej made robust for handling input images that have
      EXPTIME=0.

### 26 Nov 2002 - HAB -- Version 0.1
    - (OPR 46253)
    - First version installed in stlocal$testwf3 and delivered to OPUS.

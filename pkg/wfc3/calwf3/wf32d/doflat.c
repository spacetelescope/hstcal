/* This routine divides x in-place by the flat fields.
   There are up to three flat fields.  Each flat field is loaded
   and divided into the science image line-by-line, one flat at
   a time.

   The low-order flat, which is usually stored at a lower resolution
   than the other flats, is rebinned to match the science image before
   being applied.

   Warren Hack, 1998 June 12:
   	Initial ACS version.
   Howard Bushouse, 2000 Aug 29:
	Initial WFC3 version.
   H. Bushouse, 2001 Nov 15:
	Updated to track changes in CALACS - Fixed a major problem with
	applying reference data to sub-arrays; the indexing for the loop
	in divFlat was made consistent with the code in doDark.
   H. Bushouse, 2002 June 17:
	Revised divFlat to divide the PFLTFILE by gain before dividing
	the data by the flat-field. This converts the science data to
	units of ELECTRONS from DN (in accordance with CALACS changes).
   H. Bushouse, 2008 Oct 9:
	Added 'applygain' switch to divFlat to turn on/off the gain
	correction so that the gain will only be used to correct one ref
	file and not both, otherwise the gain will be applied twice to
	the science data.
   H. Bushouse, 2009 Jan 27:
	Fixed bugs that were causing crashes when expanding binned L-flat
	data and added capability to apply an L-flat that is the same size as
	the science image. Also inserted a forced error return if the L-flat
	needs to be interpolated, until the interpolation methods are improved.
   H. Bushouse, 2009 Oct 21:
	Updated divFlat to use the mean gain of all amps when applying
	the gain correction, except in the case of grism images, which still
	use the amp-dependent gain values.
   H. Bushouse, 2009 Nov 24:
	Updated divFlat to use the mean gain for all images, including grism.

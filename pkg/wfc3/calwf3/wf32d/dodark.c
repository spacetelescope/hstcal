/* This routine subtracts the dark image from x (in-place).
   For CCD data, the dark image is multiplied by the exposure time and
   divided by the gain before subtracting.  The dark time is just the
   exposure time; it DOES NOT INCLUDE the idle time since the last
   flushing of the chip or the readout time.

   For MAMA data, the dark image is just multiplied by the exposure time
   before subtracting.

   Reference image should have been selected to have
	the same binning factor as the science image, so
	assume ratio of bin factors to be 1.

    The value of MEANDARK is calculated based on the weighted average
    of each lines' dark value.  The weighting is based on the percent of 
    good pixels in each line, so only pixels not flagged BAD (in some way)
    will contribute to the average, and each line will contribute only 
    as much as the line has good pixels.

	Initial WFC3 Version.
   H. Bushouse, 2001 May 7:
        Updated to track ACS changes - moved AvgSciValLine and multgn1d
        routines to lib/multk1d.c module.
   H. Bushouse, 2001 Nov 15:
	Updated to track CALACS changes - revised calling sequence for
	'multgn1d' to be more general and accept arbitrary scaling factor
	instead of being hardwired to 'exptime'.

/* This routine calls synphot functions to compute values associated with
   the absolute flux calibration of the science data and populates those
   values into a set of photometry keywords in the science image header.

   Warren Hack, 1998 June 12:
   Initial ACS version.  

   Howard Bushouse, 2000 Aug 29:
   Initial WFC3 version.

   H.Bushouse, 2002 June 17:
   Removed gain normalization of PHOTFLAM keyword value, to be consistent
   with image datatype after flat-field calibration. Also, increased
   ARR_SIZE to match the default value used by SYNPHOT (in accordance
   with CALACS changes).

   H.Bushouse, 2008 Nov 5:
   Added computation of PHOTFNU keyword value, to be consistent with the
   WFC3 IR photcorr process. Also removed some old ACS-specific code that
   is not used for WFC3.

   H.Bushouse, 2011 Sep 7:
   Removed synphot dependencies and replaced with interface to new
   IMPHTTAB reference table, which returns precomputed photometric
   values.

   M. Sosey, 3, July 2013
   Added new FLUXCORR step to the pipeline to make the flux scaling for both chips
   equal. New keywords PHTFLAM1, PHTFLAM2, PHTRATIO added for tracking. PHTRATIO is
   the value chip2 is scaled by and is PHTFLAM1/PHTFLAM2

/* This routine subtracts the post-flash image from x (in-place).
   For CCD data, the post-flash image is multiplied by the postflash exposure time and
   divided by the gain before subtracting.  The flash time is given by 
   the keyword FLASHDUR, and may represent an interrupted exposure indicated
   by the keyword FLASHSTA.

   Reference image should have been selected to have
	the same binning factor as the science image, so
	assume ratio of bin factors to be 1.

    The value of MEANFLSH is calculated based on the weighted average
    of each lines' post-flash value.  The weighting is based on the percent of 
    good pixels in each line, so only pixels not flagged BAD (in some way)
    will contribute to the average, and each line will contribute only 
    as much as the line has good pixels. 
    
   Warren Hack, 2000 Sept 12:
   	Initial ACS Version.
   Warren Hack, 2000 Nov 10:
	Revised to fully support multi-amp configurations.
   Howard Bushouse, 2001 May 7:
	Initial WFC3 Version.
   H.Bushouse, 2001 Nov 16:
	Updates to track CALACS changes - Revised to scale FLSHFILE by 
	FLASHDUR instead of EXPTIME. This also required modification to
	calling sequence to 'multgn1d'.
   H.Bushouse, 2001 Dec 4:
	Added error return if reference image not binned same as the
	science image.

   M. Sosey 2013 Septamber 09:
    Updated to correctly deal with both canned and user specified sub arrays
    adding 2 new functions to the multk1d and sub1d to deal with the virtual 
    overscan and applying the correct gain value for subarrays

/* arguments:

float *meanflash    o: mean of post-flash image values subtracted

    Logic used in other parts of the pipeline

        IF AMPY > 0., then more than one AMP is used in the Y direction
        If AMPX > 0., then more than one AMP is used in the X direction
        
        So, if line being processed > AMPY then,  
            For all pixels up to AMPX, use AMP_C values 
                If AMPX is ZERO, don't use AMP_C values for any pixel
            For remaining pixels in line (or all), Use AMP_D values 
            
        However, if AMPY is ZERO or the line number > AMPY (and AMPY > 0) then,
            For all pixels up to AMPX, Use AMP_A values
                If AMPX is ZERO, don't use AMP_A values for any pixel
            Then, for remaining pixels in line (or all of them), 
                    Use AMP_B values
                    
        AMPX=AMPY=0 for all subarrays since only 1 amp is allowed according to the above logic
        which messes up the scaling call to multk1d

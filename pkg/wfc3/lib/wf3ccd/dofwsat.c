/*
  This routine compares the full-well saturation image pixels against
  those of the SingleGroup x science array pixels.  If the science array
  pixel value >= the value in the saturation image, the corresponding
  dq array pixel of the SingleGroup x is ORed with the full-well saturation
  flag, SATPIXEL, and the dq array is modified in-place.
  Note the saturation image data is only valid in the region of a
  trimmed full-frame image.  In order to apply the saturation image to the
  science data (full-frame or subarray), the starting X and Y pixels, as well
  as the X and Y sizes need to be obtained, and the saturation image properly
  overlaid on the science data.  Note that formerly the full-well saturation 
  flags were applied during doDQI.

  Michele De La Pena, 2022 March 14
  Initial implementation of the full-well saturation flagging done
  via an image.  Based on a similar routine written for ACS, as well as
  WFC3 doflash to accommodate binned or subarray data.

  Michele De La Pena, 2023 April 17
  Replace hardcoded values with variables isolated to this module.

  Michele De La Pena, 
  The ComputeLimits function has been moved to its own file in /lib.

### 19-Jul-2011 - MRD -- Version 7.1.1
    Added support for a new PCTETAB that contains time dependent CTE information.

### 13-Jul-2011 - WJH -- Version 7.1.0
    Added parallelization of CTE processing via OpenMP.

### 21-Jun-2011 - MRD -- Version 7.0.0
    Bring WFC CTE and stripe corrections from IRAF CALACS.

### 05-Apr-2011 - MRD -- Version 6.0.1
    Updated CALACS to use new IMPHTTAB reference files instead of xsynphot.

### 27-Apr-2010 - WJH -- Version 5.1.1
    Updated ACSREJ to use the same 'strtor' function used by STIS and WFC3
    which correctly handles extraneous spaces within strings, such as the
    crsigmas parameter. 
    
### 10-Aug-2009 - WJH -- Version 5.0.5
    (OPR 63285)
    SegV errors were being caused by ACSREJ not being able to read in DQ
    information in correctly when DQ array is empty on input to ACSREJ. 
    Updates to acsrej_init, acsrej_loop, and acsrej_sky were implemented
    to read in DQ header prior to calling getShortLine() so that HSTIO will
    expand any empty DQ array. This fix was originally implemented in CALWF3 
    in Dec 2007. 
    
    
### 16-Jan-2009 - WJH -- Version 5.0.4
    (OPR 61698) 
    The methods used in cleanBiasFit (in doblev.c) to compute the mean and
    standard deviation of the good pixel values and to subsequently reject
    outliers have been upgraded to take into account the pixels that have
    already been flagged upstream, as well as to check for any potential
    divide-by-zero conditions. This not only avoids the possibility of a
    divide-by-zero when all values are rejected, but also results in
    calculation of the correct mean and standard deviation - and therefore
    better outlier rejection - when an intermediate number of pixels are
    flagged. Tested against j8zs05020_asn which caused a seg fault during
    BLEVCORR prior to this fix. 
    
    (OPR 60727)
    acsrej_init.c did not correctly initialize the readnoise values 
    for each amp. 
    
    (OPR 61164)
    If given the name of a non-existent file as input, it will now quit
    gracefully. 
    
    (Trac #285)
    Reprocessing of a product/sub-product should process cleanly again.
    The changes required CALACS to recognize when it was provided a partially
    processed FLT image as input and it would copy it to a blv_tmp file for
    the remaining processing.  This would only work if overscan regions
    have been trimmed off already (BLEVCORR set to COMPLETE). It also required
    changes to GetSw to only return a value of OMIT if not PERFORM or COMPLETE.
    This mode will never be used in the operational pipeline. 
    
    (Trac #286)
    CALACS no longer crashes when the trailer file can not be written out.
    Pointer to output trailer file forced to be closed in 'trlbuf.c' if an
    error occurs in opening the output trailer file.
    

### 29-Aug-2008 - WJH -- Version 5.0.0
    (OPR 60729)
    The commanded gain values for ACS after the repair will go from
    integer values of 1,2,4,and 8 to floating point values of 0.5, 1.0,
    1.4, and 2.0. These new values will be used in the CCDTAB as well
    as in the input image headers for the CCDGAIN keyword value. The
    code was changed to check the datatype of the CCDGAIN column in
    ATODTAB,BPIXTAB, and CCDTAB and calls the correct code to read
    the values in from the table as either int or float.  This allows
    it to work with old (pre-SM4) and new (post-SM4) reference tables.


### 18-Jan-2008 - WJH -- Version 4.6.5
    (OPR 59285 )
    Negative valued pixels in SBC data cause doNoise to crash. New logic
    was added to that code to print a warning message when such a pixel is
    found, then computes the error on the abs(value).  
    
### 14-Nov-2007 - WJH -- Version 4.6.4
    (OPR 58937 )
    Added 'MJD#' to the PHOTMODE string to account for time-dependent
    sensitivity of the instruments. Tested using 'j8ui04hbq'.  

### 14-Dec-2006 - WJH -- Version 4.6.3
    (OPR 57144)
    Problems recognizing wild-card values in the BPIXTAB were corrected
    so that hot pixels will be flagged correctly in SBC data.
    

### 28-Jul-2006 - WJH -- Version 4.6.2  
    (OPR 59395)
    Logic for recognizing and ignoring flagged bad pixels during
    bias level fitting was backwards and did not reject those flagged
    pixels.  This was found by H. Bushouse during use of derived code
    in CALWF3.

    Readnoise value used for sigma clipping the values from the overscan
    regions during bias-level determination was not being determined
    correctly for all amp configurations.

### 13-Mar-2006 - WJH -- Version 4.6.1
    (OPR 54914)
    Regression testing for OPUS build 2006.3 found that
    the ASNs with multiple pointings crashed when processed
    with the version modified to address this OPR.  Sub-products
    are now assigned an ID while missing members are not. 
    
### 21-Dec-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.6.0
    (OPR 54914)
    An error in assigning IDs to sub-products caused
    seg faults when ASN members are missing. This needed
    to be fixed in 'calacs/acstable.c'.

### 09-Sep-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.5.9
    (OPR 54365)
    Another memory bug for large numbers of inputs to DTH
    association trailer files needed to be fixed. 

### 07-Jun-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.5.8
    (OPR 53088)
    A memory bug was fixed in the handling of the number of images
    each sub-product had as input.
    
### 21-Feb-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.5.6
    (OPR 53088)
    Revised 'acstable.c' to not try to create sub-products
    when there are no input exposures for the sub-product.
    
### 15-Feb-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.5.5
    - Revised memory allocation for trailer file input in ACSREJ to 
    avoid multiple calls to 'realloc' for long input lists.
    
### 14-Feb-2005 - WJH -- Version 4.5.4
    - (OPR 53050)
    Removed any reference to updateAsnStat, since only OPUS should
    update the ASN_STAT keyword in the ASN table header. 
    
### 22-Dec-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.5.3
    - (OPR 52638)
    Changed the logic for resetting the ASN member structures for each position
    to avoid having ACSREJ processing set 'sci_basic_2d' to SKIPPED for
    subsequent members of the ASN.  These structures should have been reset for
    each position, not for each product. 
    
### 22-Nov-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.5.2
    - (OPR 52474)
    Changed interpretation of position IDs in 'GetAsnTable' from 1-9A-Z to 
    simply base 10, so that '10' gets translated to 10, not 36.

### 29-Sep-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.5.1
    - (OPR 52102)
    Removed code from calacs.c that deletes input FLT images for the SFL
    product image.  This insures that all generated FLT images will be 
    available for use with MultiDrizzle in the pipeline for REPEAT-OBS ASNs.

### 19-Jul-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.5.0
    - Implemented support for applying CFLTFILE and SPOTTAB (spot flats and
        their shifts) in the FLATCORR step.
    
### 19-Mar-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.4.2
    - (OPR 50778) 
    Replaced usage of MsgText string variable for output of list of inputs
    to ACSSUM with a dynamically allocated variable to avoid array out-of-bounds
    memory problems with long lists of inputs.  This error caused a 32 image
    REPEAT-OBS ASN to fail in the pipeline (j8xd01010_asn.fits). 
    - Added calls to 'free' to clean up memory upon exiting for errors in 
    MkOutName.

### 21-Jan-2004 - WJH -- Version 4.4.1
    - (OPR 49939) Fix
    Revised the value of ATOD_SATURATE to 65534 so that comparisons for
    pixels with values greater than this will be successfully flagged as
    full-well saturated.
    
### 30 Dec 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.4
    - (OPR 50143)
    Changed the allocation of the bit-buffer in 'acsrej_loop.c' to handle
    image sizes not divisible by 8, as found in HRC-512 subarray datasets.

### 24 Nov 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.4
    - Removed SCALENSE from the computation of the error in ACSREJ.
    - (OPR 49939)
    Implemented a-to-d saturation flagging in 'dodqi' as an additional flag
    for saturation
    
    - (OPR 49938)
    Implemented 2-stage clipping in computation of bias value from overscan
    columns.  First stage will be limited to 3*sigma or 3*sqrt(mean), whichever
    is less, while second stage will be limited to 3*readnoise.
    
    - (OPR 49937)
    Fixed all obsmode strings for WFC to return with 'wfc1' for all chips.
    
    - Fixed indexing problem for subarray data in 'findover' for biassect[0].
    
    - modified 'dodqi.c' to optionally select rows on ccdamp and ccdgain,
        depending on whether the columns are present or not.  This allows
        BPIXTAB to not have those columns and have all rows apply to all 
        ccdamp/ccdgain combinations and still be compatible with BPIXTAB
        with all columns.

### 27 June 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.3a
    - Fixed implementation of updating BIASLEV keywords so that all values
      get written out to header, not just first 2 for ACS/WFC.

### 6 June 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.3
    - (OPR 46019)
    Update CALACS to populate the BIASLEV* keywords in PRIMARY header
    if they already exist.  These keywords were added in OPUS 14.3,
    which was delivered to OTFR/pipeline operations the week of 9 June 2003.
    - (OPR 48856)
    The EXPSCORR switch now gets updated after BLV_TMP files are processed
    in ACS2D.  

### 14 May 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.2c
    - (OPR 48857)
    Reworked acsrej/acsrej.c to produce SPT files for the products regardless
    of errors. This affected all datasets where all members of the ASN
    have EXPTIME=0. 

### 1 May 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.2b
    - (OPR 48858) 
    Added logic to 'doNoise' and 'doBlev' to use default ccdbias values from
    CCDTAB for chip 2 of WFC observations instead of relying on 'ampy' which
    resulted in using Chip 1 biases for Chip 2.  This only affected
    the ERR array initialization and blev subtraction for subarrays without
    overscans taken on WFC chip 2.
    
### 2 Apr 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.2a
    - (OPR 48250) 
    Modified ACSREJ to handle partial ASNs where some or all input 
    exposures have EXPTIME = 0.  
    
### 6 Mar 2003 - WJH -- Version 4.2
    - (OPR 47231) - 14Jan2003
    Revised 'photmode' to read LRFWAVE as float instead of int. 
    - (OPR 46897 - partial) - 6Mar2003
    Added the necesary code to compute the new bias keywords for each
    amp, although the code to update the headers has been commented out
    until the headers contain those keywords.
    - (OPR 47702)
    The calculations for the keyword REJ_RATE were modified to account for
    a total exptime of 0. in the event of a serious problem with the data.
    An exposure time of 1 is used instead.
    - The fitting to the overscan values for computing the bias levels was
    modified to perform a single-pass 3-sigma clip.  This clipping is done
    to remove any rows affected by cosmic-rays that have been seen to 
    incorrectly introduce a slope to the bias values subtracted from the image.

### 2002 Aug 25 - WJH
    (OPR 46650) Version 4.1c
    Changed how SCALENSE was used in computing threshhold values for 
    detecting cosmic rays, especially in SPILL pixels.  High values of 
    SCALENSE previously resulted in halos around cosmic-ray cleaned pixels.
    John Blakeslee also modified 'acsrej_init' to apply the same criteria
    when creating the initial guess image.

### 2002 Aug 19 - WJH
    (OPR 46417)
    Corrected a bug where RPT-OBS sub-products MTYPE was getting overwritten
    by the PROD-DTH MTYPE in dithered RPT-OBS associations.
    Fix involved using subprod.mtype instead of prod.mtype.      

### 2002 July 25 - WJH
    (OPR 46255)
    Removed all references to 'sflfile', output filename for ACSSUM, 
    from CALACS.  Instead replaced it with direct references to the
    association table sub-product names.  This allows RPT-OBS dithered
    observations to go to the correct sub-product filename. 

### 2002 July 9 - WJH
    (OPR 46106)
    Corrected a bug in interpreting dithered RPT-OBS observations from the
        MEMTYPES given in the assocation table. This bug caused the pipeline
        to completely crash when processing these observations, as no dither
        product was present as expected by PyDrizzle.

### 2002 June 7 - WJH
    (OPR 46036)
    Corrected the error array computation in ACSREJ to not include pixels
        affected by detected cosmic-rays in the errors.
    (OPR 46035)
    Also, fixed a memory bug in ACSSUM which caused it to crash when summing
        more than a small number of images.

### 2002 Apr 25 - WJH
    Eliminated creation of dummy/empty '_dth.fits' product. This also
        removes a dependence on 'DITHCORR'/'DRIZCORR' keyword.
    (OPR 45725)
    Added check against RPTCORR to see if any processing needs to be done.
        This allows RPT-OBS ASNs with no other processing turned on to generate
        an SFL file so that DADS can ingest the ASN. 
    (OPR 45720)
    Revert to using EXPTIME for dark scaling, and removed all computation 
        of darktime in ACSREJ.
    
    (OPR 45721) Set DQICORR to COMPLETE for CRJ products.

### 2002 Apr 17 - WJH
    (OPR 45632)
    Removed all references to STATFLAG, so that 'doStat' will always be
    performed.
    (OPR 45616) 
    Fixed a problem with ASN_STAT, so that only ASN tables will be 
    updated (not single exposures). 
    (OPR 45723)
    Correctly added DQ checking for initial guess image building in ACSREJ
    for BOTH median and minimum cases, while correcting a bug in 'median'
    case. Also, added ERR array for median image.
    Restored preface information to trailer files by backing out the 
    change in 3.5h.
    

### 2002 Apr 10 - WJH
    (OPR 45061)
    A fix apparently got dropped between 3.5e and 3.5g regarding overwriting
    of Generic Conversion comments in trailer files.  'calacs.c' was
    re-modified to correct this again.
    (OPR 45616)
    ASN_STAT needed to be modified by CALACS to reflect whether a product is
    created for an association or not. This affects whether DADS can even
    ingest the data.

### 2002 Apr 9 - WJH
    (OPR 45607)
    Update the BUNIT keyword in the SCI and ERR extension upon successful
    flat-fielding, instead of updating the Primary header.

### 2002 Apr 8 - WJH
    (OPR 45594)
    Fixed another bug in the sky calculation.  This one, pointed out by 
    the ACS IDT (Zlatan), had the histogram for sky computation in 'acsrej_sky'
    not being reset to all zero for every image, only the first.  The allocation
    of the histogram array space was not inside the loop over images, as it 
    is in CALSTIS, so it and the corresponding 'free()' call was moved inside
    the loop to correct the problem. 
    
### 2002 Apr 5 - WJH
    (OPR 45594)
    Fixed a bug in initializing the total dark time sum in 'cr_scaling.c'.
    This caused the computed dark time to be wildly wrong under some compilers.
    
    (Started adding OPR numbers to History file. These numbers refer to bug
    reports filed against CALACS during pipeline testing.)

### 2002 Mar 19 - WJH
    Fixed a bug in how the dark time is calculated for CR-combined products.
    This required updating the EXPSTART keyword with a computed value to reflect
    the actual darktime. Also, biassection values were shifted to be 0-indexed
    as they are read in from OSCNTAB.  Also, corrected an indexing error in
    BLEVDRIFT zerocol computation (found by Howard during WFC3 code work).
    Added code to report HISTORY comments on the overscan table
    used for processing (thanks to Howard for pointing out this deficiency).
    Finally, corrected the sky computation in ACSREJ to correctly bin the
    data when nbins < 1000. This bug resulted in incorrect calculation of
    final sky value.
     
### 2002 Feb 7 - WJH
    Fixed 'CalAcsRun' in 'calacs.c' to add all trailer file comments to 
    any association table trailer file regardles of whether there is a 
    final product or not.  This will ALWAYS use 'asnrootname.tra' as the
    file name for this final trailer file. 
    Fixed a bug in how the gain was applied to subarrays of the flat-fields.    

### 2002 Jan 30 - WJH
    Revised 'acs2d/doflat.c' to divide the flat-field reference file by the
    appropriate gain for each amp to be consistent with how the flat-field
    was generated. 
    Removed all normalization of photflam keyword by gain, since the
    data is now being gain corrected during flat-fielding. (acs2d/dophot.c)
    Finally, update the BUNIT keyword with the new value of 'ELECTRONS' to be
    consistent with the image type after flat-fielding now.

### 2002 Jan 24 - WJH
    Changed default array size for synphot arrays in 'dophot.c' to match
    defaults in SYNPHOT package. This affected the calculation of the 
    photometric keywords and the change now makes them completely consistent.
    
### 2002 Jan 18 - WJH
    Updated 'calacs/getflags.c' to correctly handle missing FLSHCORR keywords.
        This caused a problem with SBC files which never have that keyword,
        but HRC and WFC still need to default to 'FLSHCORR' instead of
        'POSTFLSH'.
        Also fixed a bug in trailer file management, where the OPUS comments
            were getting over-written by CALACS (in 'AppendTrlFile()').
        
### 2001 Dec 19 - WJH
    Updated all 'mkpkg' files to insure all header file dependencies were
        included. Also removed 'acssizes.h' since no code used it.
 
### 2001 Dec 17 - WJH (Version 3.5b)
    Read in 'OBSTYPE' keyword for coronographic mode and add it to
        photmode string (in 'photmode.c'). Also, convert 'POL*V' filter
        name into 'pol_v' photmode string and ignore filter names given
        as 'N/A'.

### 2001 Dec 14 - WJH (Version 3.5a)
    Updated 'doPhot' to convert POL filter strings into 'POL_UV' for
        all polarizer filter names. This was done since only POL_UV is
        used in synphot.

### 2001 Dec 10 - WJH (Version 3.5a)
    Updated 'doDQI' to apply only those rows which have the same amp,
        gain and chip values as the science image.
    Also added EXPSTART and EXPEND to the list of keywords read in by
        CALACS.  They are used for computing the DARKTIME used for
        scaling the dark image.   
    'doCCD' updates SIZAXIS keywords to be consistent with NAXIS keywords.

### 2001 Nov 9 - WJH (Version 3.5)
    The delivery of flight CCDTAB and OSCNTAB reference files came with
    a change in the columns for CCDTAB and definitions of VX/VY columns
    in OSCNTAB.  A default value of 3 for CCDOFST values was added to 
    CALACS (in 'lib/getacskeys.c') to reflect the default usage of ACS.
    'donoise.c', 'getccdtab.c' and 'acsinfo.c' were modified to translate
    the CCDOFST for each amp (of 3) into a default CCDBIAS value for each
    amp, instead of just 1 value for all amps as assumed before. The headers
    files 'acsinfo.h' and 'acs.h' were also modified to support this. Finally,
    'doblev.c' and 'blevdrift.c' were revised to report better when no
    virtual overscan is used, as that is the normal case for WFC operations.
    In addition, the method for determining the bias level for each row was
    simplified to use a polynomial fit in all cases, averaging leading and
    trailing when included in the fit. This fixes a major problem with striping
    seen when only 1 amp was used per row.  'doblev.c' was simplified,
    removing AvgBiasSect function, and 'findblev.c' was revised to use
    1 or 2 sections if present.
    

### 2001 Oct 23 - WJH (Version 3.4)
    The calculation of the photometry keywords changed dramatically
    in this version, returning to the method used by WFPC2 instead of
    using the PHOTTAB/APERTABs used by STIS.  Instead, GRAPHTAB and
    COMPTAB are now used and synphot functions are called to do the
    entire calculation.  All references to PHOTTAB and APERTAB were
    removed, the PhotInfo structure was simplified to only keep one
    wavelength and throughput array set calculated by synphot for the 
    entire obsmode.  The population of the PHOTMODE keyword was updated
    to reflect the actual component names for ACS in SYNPHOT.  This
    work addresses OPR 44676, and uses the results of OPRs 44674 and 
    44675 (for the GRAPHTAB and COMPTAB keyword addition).


### 2001 Aug 6 - WJH (Version 3.3)
    This version encompasses a number of OPR issues and bug fixes.
    The 'POSTFLSH' keyword (added for post-flash processing) has been 
    changed to 'FLSHCORR' as per OPR #43066, and this version was modified
    to accept either keyword.  An warning will be issued, though, if 
    'POSTFLSH' is found instead of 'FLSHCORR'.  In addition, the post-flash
    subtraction was modified (along with the multgn1d function) to scale by
    FLASHDUR instead of EXPTIME.  
    
    Also, a number of fixes were implemented to correctly calculate the
    trim regions for sub-arrays (OPR #44304).  Some minor fixes were also
    implemented to provide more informative error message when NULL
    strings are given as reference file names unexpectedly. Also, the code
    for 'doPhot' was revised to update the photometry keywords in all
    IMSETS, not just the first.  Finally, revisions were made to allow the
    EXPSCORR keyword to function properly requiring revisions to the
    ACSSUM and CALACS code.

### 2000 Nov 14 - WJH
	The logic for CCDAMP interpretation needed to be enhanced to accomodate
	all the combinations for both HRC and WFC.  Bugs in the 27 Oct version
	were found and needed to be corrected.  This should complete the 
	revisions necessary for all CCDAMP configurations.  In addition, the
	Post-Flash processing code was revised to properly apply the CCDAMP
	configurations.

### 2000 Oct 27 - WJH  (Version 3.2)
	This version (Version 3.2) corrects a couple of serious bugs dealing
	with single-pointing dither associations and dual-amp usage.  Revisions
	were made to 'calacs/acstable.c' to support EXP-DTH exposures without
	sub-products as would be done for single-pointing dither patterns. Also,
	lib/detnsegn.c was revised to support diagonal dual-amp usage where
	there was ambiguity in the logic regarding the application of gain values.
	The fix results in dual-amp usage being treated INTERNALLY as if it
	were a 4-amp readout with only AMPX being used.  Finally, 'lib/donoise.c'
	was revised to automatically (and correctly) detect when the AMPX
	value (plus offset) extends into the overscan at the end of each line.
	In this case (as will be for single-amp usage), the value will be 
	automatically (and internally) adjusted to the full width of the image.
	As a result, ALL AMPX and AMPY values in CCDTAB can be given in terms
	of trimmed image coordinates as exact positions.

### 2000 Sept 12 (implemented: 9 Oct 2000)
	The new version (Version 3.1) supports Post-Flash processing 
	and fixes a bug with different CCDAMP configuration support. The
	post-flash processing mimics the dark image subtraction, but gets
	performed in ACSCCD as the last processing step.  The following files 
	were modified to support this new processing step:
		acsccd/doccd.c, acsccd/acsccd.c, acsccd/mainccd.c, 
		calacs/calacs.c, lib/findover.c, lib/getflags.c, lib/sciflags.c,
		lib/acsinfo.c, lib/getacskeys.c, acsccd/getacsflag.c,
		lib/acshist.c, acsccd/doblev.c, lib/donoise.c, acs2d/dodark.c,
		lib/multk1d.c, acscorr.h, acsinfo.h.
	In addition, a new function was written to actually perform the 
	Post-Flash subtraction: acsccd/doflash.c.
	

### 2000 June 23 (implemented: 30 Aug 2000)
	This version (Version 3.0) works with the new HSTIO library for 
	accessing lines using [Get/Put]*Line functions to use zero-based
	indexes.  The changes were confined to 'ACSREJ'.  In addition, 
	changes were made to 'acsdth' to properly incorporate all input
	trailer files into the _dth product trailer file.  Also, changes 
	were made to use new HSTIO functions to support 1-D data to include
	all extensions of input SPT files into the _dth products SPT files.

### 2000 April 18
	Multiple revisions were implemented to allow subarrays and 1-amp
	readouts to process properly.  Checks were put in place when applying
	gain to each line to avoid division by zero gain for 1-amp readout.
	Also, some fixes were done in the application of sub-regions of
	reference files to the subarray data.  Finally, trailer file
	management was highly revised to eliminate the use of a TMP file.
	It now uses an in-memory buffer to hold the initial GC comments before
	overwriting the file with them so that the new CALACS comments can
	be appended. (Version 2.9g)

### 2000 April 3
	This version resets the extension which CALACS uses for the trailer
	files from '.trl' to '.tra'.  Generic Conversion uses the '.tra'
	extension by default for all their output, so this should allow
	CALACS to recognize and append to the trailer files already present
	from Generic Conversion. (Version 2.9f)

### 2000 March 21
	This minor change eliminates the use of TMP trailer files. The only
	code commented out was in 'trlbuf.c'.
	This resolves OPR #40959. (Version 2.9e)

### 2000 March 21
	CALACS was updated to reflect the bug fixes to 'acsrej_init.c' and
	'findblev.c' that came up during IPT testing.
	(Version 2.9d)

### 2000 January 12
    This version (2.9c) renames all functions that read or write keywords
    to *Key[Dbl,Flt,Int,Str,Bool].  The function names needed to be changed
    to avoid any name conflicts with similarly named HSTIO functions under
    VMS, since VMS is case-insensitive. 

### 1999 December 8
    This version (2.9b) cleans up 'acsrej_loop.c'.  Specifically,  I split
    out the shading correction buffer applied to whole lines as opposed to
    individual pixels and added explanatory comments to make the code easier
    to follow.
    
### 1999 November 11
    This version (2.9) finally includes the creation of SPT files for output
    products and sub-products.  It uses a general function, lib/mkspt.c, to
    create the new SPT file.  This function was added to 'acsrej.c',
    'acssum.c' and 'acsdth.c'.  In addition, a fix was included to properly
    apply binned shading file to subarrays.  
    WJH

### 1999 October 21
    ACSREJ:
        Final revisions were made to 'acsrej_check.c',
        'mainrej.c', 'cr_scaling.c', 'acsrej.c', and 'acsrej_loop.c' to
        address the last of the code review comments.  
        Specifically, 'return(status)' replaced 'exit' outside of 'main' and
        'WhichError()' is called upon exiting.  In addition, 'getACSnsegn' was
        revised to use 'for()' loops over all the keywords.  Finally, 
        shading correction in 'acsrej_loop' was revised to use the same 
        code for all cases of binning and offsets.

### 1999 October 18
    ACSREJ:
        Errors in the buffer management were corrected in this version (2.8b).
        The buffers were getting filled with un-normalized data, but then
        scrolled after being normalized, resulting in a buffer with both
        normalized and un-normalized data.  This caused the CR-detection 
        algorithm and SPILL-detection routine to fail.  
        In addition, indexing in SPILL-detection section was incorrect for
        'jj', and DQ values were being remembered only for the last image.
        These errors were corrected and the use of 'dqpat' was made more
        robust in the CR-detection section.

### 1999 September 10
    This version reflects all the changes performed to address the issues
    and bugs revealed during code reviews of 'ACS2D' and 'ACSREJ'.
    See 'acsrej/history' for a list of revision descriptions for that task.
    

### 1999 January 14
	Revisions were made to the trailer file handling functions to 
	clean up some bugs found in code review.  In addition, saving
	temp files was linked to the keyword EXPSCORR as originally planned.
	In addition, command line syntax errors are not recorded in trailer
	files, while other bugs were corrected based on code reviews of 
	ACSCCD and the first half of ACS2D.  
	
	Also, ACSCCD was modified to only output an overscan-trimmed image
	in the case of successful BLEVCORR, while ACS2D now checks to see
	that the overscan regions have been trimmed by examining the LTV
	keywords in the input files.
	
	This release was ACS_CAL_VER 2.0 and represents the first delivery
	to STLOCAL and OPUS.
	

### 1998 November 24
	Trailer file management was added to CALACS.  This required the 
	replacement of all 'asnmessage/asnwarn/asnerror' calls with calls
	to 'trlmessage/trlwarn/trlerror' found in 'lib/trlbuf.c'.
	
		lib/trlbuf.c	Contains all the functions required for trailer
						file management.  The trailer file buffer is 
						global to that file.
		
		lib/mkpkg		Added trlbuf.c
		


### 1998 November 11
	
	This is the first essentially complete version of the CALACS package.
	All basic functionality has been incorporated, including the following
	recent additions:

	acsversion.h, "0.7a (11-Nov-1998)"
	
	All routines which created output statements were converted to 
	the use of asnwarn,asnmessage, or asnerror, as appropriate.  These
	routines were then added to 'acs.h' for global use, along with the
	definition of MsgText, which is used as a 1 line buffer for creating
	custom output strings with 'sprintf'.  

	
	Multi-amp usage has been incorporated into all functions which applied
	read-noise and gain to the image data; primarily,
		acsrej/acsrej_init.c
		acsrej/acsrej_loop.c
		lib/detnsegn.c			- functions for determining what noise
									and gain values are appropriate for a pixel
		lib/donoise.c
	
	Also, determination of bias levels were revised to take into account
	what amps were being used, and what bias sections were specified in 
	the overscan table (acsccd/doblev.c).
	
	In addition, the function 'acsdth' was created in the CALACS task to
	create an empty DTH product when one was specified in the association
	table. (calacs/acsdth.c).

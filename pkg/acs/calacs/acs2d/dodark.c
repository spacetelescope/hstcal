/* This routine subtracts the dark image from x (in-place).
 For CCD data, the dark image is multiplied by the dark time
 before subtracting.  The dark time is the DARKTIME value, if available.
 Else, it is exposure time + FLASHDUR;
 for post-SM4 non-BIAS WFC, it also INCLUDES the idle time since the last
 flushing of the chip or the readout time.

 For MAMA data, the dark image is just multiplied by the exposure time
 before subtracting.

 Reference image should have been selected to have
 the same binning factor as the science image, so
 assume ratio of bin factors to be 1.

 The value of MEANDARK is calculated based on the weighted average
 of each lines' dark value.  The weighting is based on the percent of
 good pixels in each line, so only pixels not flagged BAD (in some way)
 will contribute to the average, and each line will contribute only
 as much as the line has good pixels.

 ----       ------      -----------
 1998-06-11 W.J. Hack   Initial ACS Version.
 1999-07-27 W.J. Hack   Added weighting to calculation of MEANDARK.
                        Use same code for all bin cases.
 2000-04-14 W.J. Hack   Fixed the code which applies the gain to each line
                        so that if there is only 1 AMP used per line,
                        it doesn't try to apply a second amp with gain = 0.
 2001-04-16 W.J. Hack   Revised calling sequence for 'multgn1d' to be more
                        general  and accept arbitrary scaling factor instead
                        of being hardwired to 'exptime'.
 2001-12-04 W.J. Hack   Compute darktime from exposure time keywords
                        EXPSTART, EXPEND and use it instead of EXPTIME for
                        scaling dark image.
 2002-04-24 W.J. Hack   Reverted back to using EXPTIME for scaling dark image.
 2012-12-11 P.L. Lim    Now use DARKTIME variable for scaling dark image.
 2016-01-15 P.L. Lim    Now use DARKTIME keyword, if available.

/* This routine subtracts the dark image from x (in-place).
 For CCD data, the dark image is multiplied by the dark time
 before subtracting.  The dark time is the exposure time + FLASHDUR;
 for post-SM4 non-BIAS WFC, it also INCLUDES the idle time since the last
 flushing of the chip or the readout time.
 
 For MAMA data, the dark image is just multiplied by the exposure time
 before subtracting.
 
 Reference image should have been selected to have
 the same binning factor as the science image, so
 assume ratio of bin factors to be 1.
 
 The value of MEANDARK is calculated based on the weighted average
 of the image where the weighting is based on the percent of 
 good pixels in the image.  Only pixels not flagged BAD (in some way)
 will contribute to the average.
 
 Warren Hack, 1998 June 11:
 Initial ACS Version.
 Warren Hack, 1999 July 27:
 Added weighting to calculation of MEANDARK.  Use same code for all bin
 cases.
 Warren Hack, 2000 April 14:
 Fixed the code which applies the gain to each line so that if
 there is only 1 AMP used per line, it doesn't try to apply a 
 second amp with gain = 0.
 Warren Hack, 2001 April 16:
 Revised calling sequence for 'multgn1d' to be more general
 and accept arbitrary scaling factor instead of being hardwired
 to 'exptime'.
 Warren Hack, 2001 December 4:
 Compute darktime from exposure time keywords EXPSTART,EXPEND
 and use it instead of EXPTIME for scaling dark image.
 Warren Hack, 2002 Apr 24:
 Reverted back to using EXPTIME for scaling dark image.
 Pey Lian Lim, 2012 Dec 11:
 Now use DARKTIME for scaling dark image.
 M.D. De La Pena, 2018 June 05:
 Dark correction processing is now done on the entire image instead of 
 line by line. Also, performed some clean up and new commentary.
 M.D. De La Pena, 2019 November 26:
 Removed hard-coded darktime scaling value and read new
 post-flashed and unflashed columns from updated CCDTAB reference
 file to use for the offset to the DARKTIME FITS keyword value
 under appropropriate date and supported subarray criteria.  The
 DARKTIME keyword value is now the default scaling factor for the
 superdarks, with the offset being an additive correction to DARKTIME
 under appropriate circumstances. The offset values is applicable for 
 WFC and HRC only.
 M.D. De La Pena, 2021 May 24:
 Moved the computation of the darktime with the additive correction using
 post-flashed and unflashed values in the CCDTAB to the acsccd module.
 In this way every blv_tmp will have the correct DARKTIME keyword value.

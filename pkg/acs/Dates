 08-Feb-2022   CALACS 10.3.5 Update to the cosmic ray rejection algorithm as to the way
                             the output ERR extension is computed for the CRJ file. The 
                             output ERR is now propagated from the usable input ERR extensions
                             versus being computed by a model.
 11-Jan-2022   CALACS 10.3.4 Fixed a bug which was triggered ONLY when executing the condaforge
                             distribution on MacOS where failure was due to a missing return statement.
                             Only call computeDarktime() once to compute the updated 
                             DARKTIME primary keyword and function return is now void. Update
                             the keyword in main to avoid passing extra data by reference.
 24-May-2021   CALACS 10.3.3 Fixed a bug associated with the FLASHDUR computation.  The FLASHDUR
                             keyword was updated in the CRJ/CRC headers to be the sum of
                             the individual input images as this keyword is used in ACS2D to
                             scale the flash reference file for flash correction.  Fixed a bug
                             associated with the DARKTIME computation.  Code written for CALACS
                             10.2.2 was moved from ACS2D to ACSCCD so every BLV_TMP file has the
                             correct DARKTIME keyword value. Also, the DARKTIME keyword was updated
                             in the CRJ/CRC headers to be the sum of the individual input images. Only
                             the DARKTIME value in the input file header is used to scale the dark
                             reference file for the dark correction.
 26-Apr-2021   CALACS 10.3.2 Fixed a bug introduced when the build manager reworked code to
                             remove circular dependencies caused by the introduction of the
                             acscteforwardmodel code.  The name of the executable was
                             inadvertently changed from "acscteforwardmodel.e" to
                             "acsforwardmodel.e".  The ACS team requested the name be
                             changed back to the original as scripts and documentation
                             are impacted.
 07-Apr-2021   CALACS 10.3.1 Fixed a bug introduced when the build manager reworked code to
                             remove circular dependencies caused by the introduction of the
                             acscteforwardmodel code.  Resolved the segmentation fault when
                             trying to execute the standalone executables "acscte.e" and
                             "acsforwardmodel.e".
 12-Feb-2021                 Done during build creation for operations for 10.3.0 -
                             Build manager made changes to the main routines and wscript
                             files (predominantly) to eliminate some circular dependency.
 31-Dec-2020   CALACS 10.3.0 Implementation to use an image to detect and flag full-well
                             saturation versus a simple scalar.  The new routine,
                             dofwsat.c, is modelled on dobias.c. The detect/flagging
                             occurs after bias correction, conversion to electrons, and
                             blev correction.  Build manager made changes to the main
                             routines and wscript files (predominantly) to eliminate
                             some circular dependency.
 24-Jun-2020:  CALACS 10.2.4 Removed/modified/updated routines which used copyrighted
                             code. Updates implemented Oct 2019, but installation delayed 
                             for higher priority updates.
 29-Apr-2020   CALACS 10.2.3 Modified "dodqi" to accommodate the A-to-D saturation threshold 
                             which is now defined in the CCDTAB. The threshold is no longer 
                             a constant and has different behavior pre- and post-SM4.
 10-Jan-2020   CALACS 10.2.2 Removed hard-coded darktime scaling value and read new 
                             post-flashed and unflashed columns from updated CCDTAB reference 
                             file to use for the offset to the DARKTIME FITS keyword value 
                             under appropropriate date and supported subarray criteria.  The 
                             DARKTIME keyword value is now the default scaling factor for the 
                             superdarks, with the offset being an additive correction to DARKTIME 
                             under appropriate circumstances.  The offset only applies to WFC and HRC.
 25-Sep-2019   CALACS 10.2.1 CALACS has been modified to allow the PHOTMODE keyword
                             to be updated with the MJDUTC for the SBC, in addition to
                             the HRC and WFC. This will allow time-dependent sensitivity
                             to be applied properly to SBC.
 06-Mar-2019:  CALACS 10.2.0 ACSREJ treats Bias and Dark image combination
                             differently than other data.  ACSREJ ignores the 
                             bad pixels (BPIXTAB flag of 4) during the combination 
                             (i.e. treat bad pixels as normal pixels).
 09-Aug-2018:  CALACS 10.1.0 ACS2D/DARKCORR step works directly on the full 2D
                             data rather than on a line-by-line basis PR#315.
                             ACSCCD/BLEVCORR step accommodates the new supported
                             subarrays which have both physical and virtual overscan
                             Forward model functionality was implemented which
                             simulates (adds) the trails. This functionality should
                             be accessed via the new ACSTOOLS function, acscteforwardmodel.py
 19-Jan-2018:  CALACS 10.0.0 ACSREJ calculations are done entirely in electrons.
                             Threshold formula uses ERR arrays to account for
                             post-flash noise.  CALACS uses amp-dependent read
                             noise as threshold to determine if a pixel has enough
                             S/N such that a reasonable correction can be applied.

                                biassection shifted to 0-index from 1-index
  7-Feb-2002:  CALACS 3.5e Fixed trailer file creation for ASN tables, updated

   Phil Hodge, before 1997 Dec 9:
	Functions created.

   Phil Hodge, 2000 Mar 10:
	Include option to evaluate prism dispersion relation, using
	functions SolveDisp and PrismDisp.

   Phil Hodge, 2000 May 31:
	In EvalDisp, add a seventh term (cubic) in the dispersion relation.

   Phil Hodge, 2001 Feb 22:
	Move prism macros to ../stis.h.

   Phil Hodge, 2001 May 2:
	Move the call to GetDisp from here to Do2Dx, and add disp to
	calling sequence.

   Ivo Busko, 2002 Mar 5:
   	Move EvalDisp to its own file. It is required by the blaze
   	shift algorithm.

   Ivo Busko, 2002 Mar 6:
   	Add GetWavelength function.

   Phil Hodge, 2010 July 30:
	Rename EvalDisp to EvalDisp7, and change the file name to evaldisp7.c.
	Delete PrismDisp; call evalDisp or prismDisp.

/* This routine corrects the output SCI and ERR data (in-place) for
   telescope throughput and detector sensitivity.  The data before
   correction are expected to be in counts; after correction the BUNIT
   keyword in the science and error extension headers will be set to
   "erg /s /cm**2 /angstrom /arcsec**2".

   Counts are converted to specific intensity by multiplying by:

				h * c * atodgain
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	exptime * R(lambda) * lambda * hst_area * disp * scale * width

   where:

	h = Planck's constant (erg * sec); c = speed of light (cm / sec)
	atodgain = analog to digital gain (electrons / dn)
	exptime = exposure time (sec)
	lambda = wavelength (cm)
	R(lambda) = instrumental response (e.g. output from synphot.calcband)
	hst_area = area of HST (cm**2), _including_ obscured regions
	disp = dispersion (angstrom / pixel)
	scale = image scale along slit (arcsec / pixel)
	width = slit width (arcsec)

   The R(lambda) that we got from the phottab is for an "infinite"
   extraction box height, which is what we need for a diffuse source.

   The DIFF2PT keyword is assigned the value (scale * width * pcorr) / Ta,
   where Ta is the aperture throughput for a point source, scale and width
   are as above, and pcorr is the factor read from the PCTAB, the ratio of
   R(lambda) for an infinite extraction box height divided by R(lambda)
   for the default extraction box.  DIFF2PT will be written to the SCI
   extension header.  Since Ta and pcorr are functions of wavelength and
   we only write one value to the header, we average the throughput over
   the wavelength range of the current extension when computing DIFF2PT.
### (Actually, this range is too large because it covers the full output
   image in the dispersion direction rather than just the pixels mapped
   from points within the input image.)
   For a point source, to convert the specific intensity to flux density
   Flambda, sum the SCI image values along the length of the slit and
   multiply the sum by DIFF2PT.

   Phil Hodge, 1997 Sept 5:
	Include atodgain as a factor.
	plate_scale is now an array of two elements, to allow for unequal
	binning in the two axes.

   Phil Hodge, 1997 Nov 13:
	Assume dispaxis = 1, and remove it from the calling sequence.
	Correct R(lambda) for default extraction box height using pcorr
	in the phot struct, and take account of this in the DIFF2PT factor.

   Phil Hodge, 1998 Jan 26:
	Remove the pcorr factor from the calibration for diffuse source;
	that is, assume R(lambda) is for an infinite extraction box height.
	(We've been assuming all along that R(lambda) has been corrected
	for the aperture throughput.)

   Phil Hodge, 2001 Feb 20:
	Check for zero or negative wavelength (needed for prism).

   Ivo busko, 2002 Jan 10:
	Time-dependent sensitivity correction.

   Ivo busko, 2002 Mar 6:
	MSM/blaze shift correction.

   Ivo Busko, 2002 Apr 24:
        Output blaze shift value.

   Phil Hodge, 2004 Dec 27:
	Change the calling sequence of TdsCorrection, to include
	temperature dependence in addition to time.

   Phil Hodge, 2010 Mar 24:
	Mike Droettboom discovered by using valgrind that tds_starti was not
	initialized.  Instead, thr_starti was initialized twice, so the
	second statement has been changed to initialize tds_starti.

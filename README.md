# HSTCAL

Calibration software for HST/WFC3, HST/ACS, and HST/STIS.

HSTCAL is a C-based package which is comprised of the science calibration
software in support of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) pipelines. Initially, the
pipelines were written using C, but were encapsulated within the IRAF/STSDAS
environment, relying on IRAF to perform I/O and other basic interface
functions. HSTCAL replaces all the low-level IRAF-based functionality with routines
based on the third-party package CFITSIO. This allows all the pipeline
software to be compiled and run without any dependence on IRAF. Not only
can HST data be processed using the C code directly via the C executables,
but the pipelines can also be run by using a high-level Python interface
(via [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html))
comprised of thin wrappers for the C executables. The wrappers are available
as part of the `xxxtools` Python packages mentioned below.

## Install using Conda (Complete Calibration Environment)

[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/spacetelescope/stenv)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stenv/releases)

HSTCAL can be obtained as part of the
[Space Telescope Environment (stenv)](https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
a conda environment.  The instructions found at this URL describe
choosing the ``stenv`` release, building the ``stenv``
environment from the YAML file, and activating your new environment. Once your environment
is activated, you can invoke any of the HSTCAL executables.

```bash
# Use HSTCAL
$ calacs.e [...]
$ calwf3.e [...]
$ cs[...].e
```

## Install using Conda (HSTCAL only)

![Anaconda ver badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hstcal/badges/version.svg)
![Anaconda platform badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hstcal/badges/platforms.svg)

The [HSTCAL package is resident on conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hstcal)
and you can use the following command to perform the installation:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge hstcal==X.Y.Z
```
The `X.Y.Z` is the desired version number.

## Source Installation

See [detailed installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

## Instrument-specific Instructions

The following environment variables must be defined for the respective `cal[...].e` pipelines
to be able to find calibration reference files. For more information, see the
[CRDS user guide](https://hst-crds.stsci.edu/static/users_guide/index.html).

### ACS

`jref` must point to a path containing ACS reference files. For example:

```bash
export jref="/grp/crds/cache/references/hst/"
```

If your machine is not connected to the Central Storage mentioned above, please set
the location to where the calibration reference files exist on your own machine.

For more information, please see the [ACS Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/acsdhb)
and the [acstools documentation](https://acstools.readthedocs.io/).

### WFC3

`iref` must point to a path containing WFC3 reference files. For example:

```bash
export iref="/grp/crds/cache/references/hst/"
```

If your machine is not connected to the Central Storage mentioned above, please set
the location to where the calibration reference files exist on your own machine.

For more information, please see the [WFC3 Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb)
and the [wfc3tools documentation](https://wfc3tools.readthedocs.io/).

### STIS

`oref` must point to a path containing STIS reference files. For example:

```bash
export oref="/grp/crds/cache/references/hst/"
```

If your machine is not connected to the Central Storage mentioned above, please set
the location to where the calibration reference files exist on your own machine.

For more information, please see the [STIS Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/stisdhb)
and the [stistools documentation](https://stistools.readthedocs.io/).

## Other Software

The following are also part of the standard HST pipeline, but are independent software
packages written in Python or Python layered on C:

* COS pipeline (`calcos` and `costools`): See [COS Data Handbook](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/cos/documents/handbooks/datahandbook/COS_cover.html) and [costools documentation](https://costools.readthedocs.io/)
* [Drizzlepac](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/drizzlepac.html)

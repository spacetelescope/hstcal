# Installation

## Supported Platforms

- Linux >=RHEL6
- OS X >=10.5


## Build requirements

- cmake >=3.11 (https://cmake.org)
- cfitsio >=3.430 (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html)
- gcc >=4.4.7 (https://gcc.gnu.org)
- openmp (http://www.openmp.org/)
- pkg-config (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config)

## Testing requirements

- python >=3.11 (https://www.python.org)
- pytest
- crds
- ci-watson

GCC may be supplemented by Clang under the following conditions:

- Clang must be compiled with OpenMP support
- A Fortran compiler must be available in `$PATH`


## Prerequisites


### CFITSIO

- Must be compiled as a shared library.

- If `libcfitsio` has been installed to a non-standard path such as `$HOME/programs/cfitsio`, you will need to adjust
  `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` so that `pkg-config` is able to find it:

    ```bash
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/programs/cfitsio/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    ```

- If you prefer not to use `pkg-config` set `WITH_CFITSIO` to the top-level path where cfitsio is installed.

    ```
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    cmake .. -DWITH_CFITSIO=$HOME/programs/cfitsio
    ```

### OpenMP

- If you do not have OpenMP or want to disable OpenMP support, set the `ENABLE_OPENMP` option to `OFF`.

    ```
    cmake .. -DENABLE_OPENMP=OFF
    ```


## Build on Linux

### Debian / Ubuntu

```
apt install cmake libcfitsio-dev gcc gfortran pkg-config
```

### Fedora

```
dnf install cmake cfitsio-devel gcc gcc-gfortran pkgconf-pkg-config
```

### Conda / Mamba

```
conda create -n hstcal -c conda-forge cmake compilers cfitsio pkgconfig python
conda activate hstcal
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib"
```

### Install

1. Configure

    ```
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    ```

   If you use Conda/Mamba, you can install it to the env directly; however, note that this would overwrite any previous 
   `hstcal` installation from `conda-forge` channel:

    ```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
    ```

   Otherwise, you can install it to a path you have write access to, e.g.:

    ```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/hstcal
    ```

2. Build

    ```
    make
    ```

3. Install

    ```
    make install
    ```

4. Add HSTCAL to `$PATH` (skip for Conda/Mamba)

    ```bash
    export PATH=$HOME/hstcal/bin:$PATH
    ```

## Build on MacOS / OS X

The LLVM/Clang suite provided by Apple XCode is not sufficient to compile HSTCAL. Please install GCC (C and Fortran
compilers) either from source, or using a package management system such as Homebrew, MacPorts, Fink, or Conda.


### MacPorts

```
port install cmake cfitsio gcc13 pkgconfig +openmp
export CC=gcc-mp-13
export CXX=g++-mp-13
export FC=gfortran-mp-13
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/opt/local/lib"
```

### Homebrew

```
brew install cmake cfitsio gcc pkgconfig
export CC=gcc-13
export CXX=gcc-13
export FC=gfortran-13
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/lib"
```

### Conda / Mamba

```
conda create -n hstcal -c conda-forge cmake compilers cfitsio pkgconfig python
conda activate hstcal
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$CONDA_PREFIX/lib"
```

### Install

1. Configure

    ```
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    ```

   If you use Conda/Mamba, you can install it to the env directly; however, note that this would overwrite any previous
   `hstcal` installation from `conda-forge` channel:

    ```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
    ```

   Otherwise, you can install it to a path you have write access to, e.g.:

    ```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/hstcal
    ```

2. Build

    ```
    make
    ```

3. Install

    ```
    make install
    ```

4. Add HSTCAL to `$PATH` (skip for Conda/Mamba)

    ```bash
    export PATH=$HOME/hstcal/bin:$PATH
    ```

## Debugging

To enable support for debugging symbols use one of the following defines:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[RelWithDebInfo|Debug]
```

To enable memory leak and heap overflow detection:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_ASAN=ON [-DENABLE_ASAN_RECOVER=ON]
```

When ASAN (aka AddressAnalyzer) encounters a bug it halts execution and dumps information about the type of error, and
where it occurred. When `ENABLE_ASAN_RECOVER` is enabled, and the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable contains 
`halt_on_error=0`, ASAN will continue to dump information as the program runs. This is mode is incredibly noisy, so it
should only ever be used to test code changes in development.
